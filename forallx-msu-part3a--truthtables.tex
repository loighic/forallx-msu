\chapter{Characteristic truth tables}
\label{s:CharacteristicTruthTables}

Any non-atomic sentence of TFL is composed of atomic sentences with sentential connectives. The truth value of the compound sentence depends on the truth value of the atomic sentences that comprise it. To know the truth value of `$(D \eand E)$', for instance, you need to know the truth value of `$D$' and the truth value of `$E$'. You also, however, need to know the rule for when a conjunction is true and when it is false. 

We introduced five connectives in chapter \ref{s:TFLConnectives}, and now we need to explain when sentences using each connective are true and false. For convenience, we will abbreviate `True' with `T' and `False' with `F'. (But just to be clear, the two truth values are \textit{true} and \textit{false}; the truth values are not letters!)

\newglossaryentry{truth value}
                 {
                   name = truth value,
                   description = {One of the two logical values sentences can have: True and False}
                   }

\paragraph{Conjunction.} For any sentences \meta{A} and \meta{B}, the conjunction (\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}) is true if and only if both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true. If one or both of \meta{A} and \meta{B} are false, then the sentence (\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}) is false. We can summarize this in the {characteristic truth table} for conjunction:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c |c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & F\\
F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

That's a truth table. At the top (above the horizontal line) we have, on the right, the sentence whose truth and falsity we are investigating. On the left, are all of the atomic sentences that appear in the sentence on the right. 

Below the horizontal line on the left are different combinations of \textit{true} and \textit{false} for the atomic sentences. On the first line, there is a `T' below \meta{A} and a `T' below \meta{B}. So, this line represents the situation where \meta{A} is true and \meta{B} is true. What does that mean for the sentence $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$? Of course, you know. But you can look on the right side of the truth table, on line 1, and see that, in this situation, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is true. Likewise, on line 2, there is a `T' below \meta{A} and an `F' below \meta{B}. Checking the right side, then, we see that when \meta{A} is true and \meta{B} is false, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is false. That's the basic idea, although there is more explanation and some examples in the next chapter. 

Note that conjunction is \emph{symmetrical}. The truth value for $\meta{A} \eand \meta{B}$ is always the same as the truth value for $\meta{B} \eand \meta{A}$.  

\paragraph{Negation.} For any sentence \meta{A}: If \meta{A} is true, then \enot\meta{A} is false. If \meta{A} is false, then \enot\meta{A} is true. We can summarize this in the \emph{characteristic truth table} for negation:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\meta{A} & \enot\meta{A}\\
\hline
T & F\\
F & T 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Disjunction.} Recall that `$\eor$' always represents inclusive-or. So, for any sentences \meta{A} and \meta{B}, the disjunction $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is true when either \meta{A} or \meta{B} or both are true. The only instance when $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is false is when both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are false. We can summarize this in the {characteristic truth table} for disjunction:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eor\meta{B}$ \\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & T\\
F & T & T\\
F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This is a good time to explain another point. We are, in this chapter, simply defining the characteristic truth table for each connective. We have reasons for defining them these ways, and there is a consensus that these are the best definitions. But, in the end, these are the correct truth tables for each connective because these are the ways that we have chosen to set them. Conceivably, we could say that $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is false when both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are false \textit{and} when both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true. That would agree with the way that we, at least some of the time, use \textit{or} in English. But that's not what we've chosen to do, and so the way that $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is defined in the truth table above is going to apply from this point forward (and similarly for all of the other connectives). 

%Like conjunction, disjunction is symmetrical. 

\paragraph{Conditional.} The conditional is interesting and, for some, philosophically contentious. You may know that one way to think about the conditional is as rule: if the antecedent happens, then the consequent has to happen. So, for instance, take the conditional `if I am at the grocery store, I am getting bread'. This sentence is obviously true when (1) I go to the grocery store and get bread. Conversely, this sentence is false when (2) I go to the grocery store, but don't buy bread. (If that happens, the rule has been broken.) Those two scenarios are represented by lines 1 and 2 in the characteristic truth table for the conditional.

For the other two scenarios, we have to concentrate a bit. The sentence is also true when (3) I'm not at the grocery store, but I'm getting bread somewhere else. In this case, the rule \textit{if I am at the grocery store, then I am getting bread} hasn't been broken; it just doesn't really apply. So, when the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, the conditional is true. That's represented by line 3 of the characteristic truth table for the conditional. Similarly, when (4) I am not at the grocery store, and I am not getting bread, the rule hasn't been broken. It just hasn't been invoked at all. So even though the antecedent didn't happen and the consequent didn't happen, the sentence is still true. (Again, it's still true that \textit{if I am at the grocery store, then I am getting bread}, but since, let's say, I'm home taking a nap, it's false that `I am at the grocery store' and it's false that `I am buying bread'.) 

We summarize all of this with the characteristic truth table for the conditional:
\begin{center}\label{characteristic-tt-conditional}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eif\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & T\\
F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Hopefully, you understood the explanation just given for each of the four scenarios. The conditional is philosophically contentious, however, because every conditional is not as simple and straightforward as `if I am at the grocery store, then I am getting bread'. Take a conditional where the antecedent is always false: `if the queen of England is on the moon, then Mississippi State University is in Starkville.' This isn't much of a rule, but it is a conditional. And since the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, the sentence is true. Even stranger, consider this conditional: `if the queen of England is on the moon, then pigs can fly.' Now, the antecedent is false and the consequent is false, but, as is shown in line 4 of the truth table, the sentence is true. 

Sometimes the truth values for the antecedent, the consequent, and the whole conditional make sense (as in our first example) and sometimes they seem odd. That has generated philosophical debate, but it actually does not present a problem for us. The conditional is very precisely defined by the characteristic truth table for the conditional---as are sentences using all of the connectives. We, then, simply use that definition, and we don't have to make any decisions about whether a particular conditional should really be true or false. 

Also, unlike the conjunction and the disjunction, the conditional is \emph{asymmetrical}. You cannot swap the antecedent and consequent without changing the meaning of the sentence, because $\meta{A}\eif\meta{B}$ has a very different truth table from $\meta{B}\eif\meta{A}$.


\paragraph{Biconditional.} Since a biconditional is to be the same as the conjunction of a conditional running in each direction, the truth table for the biconditional is this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eiff\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & F\\
F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Unsurprisingly, the biconditional is symmetrical.

\chapter{Complete truth tables}
\label{s:CompleteTruthTables}

In chapter \ref{s:CharacteristicTruthTables}, we examined the characteristic truth table for each connective. Those truth tables define the truth values for each connective. For example, $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is false when \meta{A} and \meta{B} are both false, otherwise it is true; and so on for the other connectives. Now that we have those definitions, we can investigate when other, more complex sentences are true and false---for instance, ones like `$(H\eand I)\eif H$' and `$(M \eand (N \eor P))$', which we will go through in this chapter. Once we understand how to create truth tables, we can investigate other properties of sentences, which we will do in chapters \ref{s:SemanticConcepts} and \ref{c:tt-validity}. 

Before we begin, we will define \define{valuation}.
	\factoidbox{
		A \define{valuation} is any assignment of truth values to particular atomic sentences of TFL.
	}

        \newglossaryentry{valuation}
{
name=valuation,
description={An assignment of \glspl{truth value} to particular atomic \glspl{sentence of TFL}}
}

\noindent \textbf{So, each row of a truth table represents a possible valuation. The entire truth table represents all possible valuations.} Thus, the truth table provides us with a way of finding the truth values of complex sentences on each possible valuation---that is, for every combination of `true' and `false' for every atomic sentence. This is easiest to explain by example.

\section{An example}\label{s:tt-example}
Consider the sentence `$(H\eand I)\eif H$', which contains three atomic sentences, although only two different ones. We set up the truth table for this sentence by putting $H$ and $I$ on the left side of the vertical line and `$(H\eand I)\eif H$' on the right. (Although $H$ appears twice in `$(H\eand I)\eif H$', we only need one $H$ on the left.) Below the $H$ and $I$ on the left side, we put every combination of `T' and `F'. That is, on one line we want to have T and T; on another we want to have T and F; on another F and T; and on another F and F. 

Since we have two atomic sentences on the left, there are four combinations of true and false. For consistency, the Ts and Fs should always be listed this way: (a) in the first column (the one next to the vertical line), they alternate T, F, T, F; (b) in the second column, they alternate in pairs, T, T, F, F; and (c) if there are more atomic sentences than just $H$ and $I$, then more columns and more rows are needed, but the pattern remains the same. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T\\
 T & F\\
 F & T\\
 F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Once the left side of the truth table is filled in, we copy (\textbf{just copy}) the truth values for the atomic sentences to the right-side of the truth table. For the $H$, that gives us:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & {T} & &  & & {T}\\
 T & F & {T} & &  & & {T}\\
 F & T & {F} & &  & & {F}\\
 F & F & {F} & &  & & {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
And then we add the truth values for $I$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & {T} & & {T} & & {T}\\
 T & F & {T} & & {F} & & {T}\\
 F & T & {F} & & {T} & & {F}\\
 F & F & {F} & & {F} & & {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now consider the subsentence `$(H\eand I)$'. This is a conjunction, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$, and our next step is to determine the truth values  for just this subsentence. The characteristic truth table for conjunction gives the truth conditions for \emph{any} sentence of the form $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$, whatever $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ might be. It represents the point that a conjunction is true only when both conjuncts are true. In this case, our conjuncts are `$H$' and `$I$'. They are both true on (and only on) the first line of the truth table. Accordingly, we put `T' on the first line below the `$\eand$' and `F' on each of the other lines.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & T & \textbf{T} & T & & T\\
 T & F & T & \textbf{F} & F & & T\\
 F & T & F & \textbf{F} & T & & F\\
 F & F & F & \textbf{F} & F & & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now, that we have the truth values for $(H \eand I)$ the sentence that we are dealing with is a conditional. `$(H \eand I)$'  is the antecedent of this conditional and `$H$' is the consequent. To simplify the table before our next step, we will just show the truth values for the antecedent and the consequent.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
% & &  & \meta{A} &  &\eif &\meta{B} \\
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T &  & {T} &  &  & T\\
 T & F &  & {F} &  &  & T\\
 F & T &  & {F} &  &  & F\\
 F & F &  & {F} &  &  & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
To complete the truth table, we must determine the truth values for this conditional. On the first row, `$(H\eand I)$' is true and the consequent, `$H$', is true. Since a conditional is true when the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, we write a `T' in the first row underneath the conditional symbol. On the second row, `$(H\eand I)$' is false and `$H$' is true. Since a conditional is true whenever the antecedent is false (check p.~\pageref{characteristic-tt-conditional}), we write a `T' in the second row underneath the conditional symbol. We continue for the last two rows and get this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
% & &  & \meta{A} &  &\eif &\meta{B} \\
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T &  & {T} &  &\textbf{T} & T\\
 T & F &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & T\\
 F & T &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & F\\
 F & F &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The conditional is the main logical operator of the sentence, so the column of `T's underneath the conditional tells us that the sentence `$(H \eand I)\eif H$' is true regardless of the truth values of `$H$' and `$I$'. Those atomic sentences can be true or false in any combination, and the full sentence, `$(H \eand I)\eif H$', still comes out true. Since we have considered all four possible assignments of truth and falsity to `$H$' and `$I$', we can say that `$(H \eand I)\eif H$' is true on every \textit{valuation}.

In this example, we have not repeated all of the entries in every column in every successive table. When actually writing truth tables on paper, however, it is impractical to erase whole columns or rewrite the whole table for every step. Although it is more crowded, a complete truth table looks like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & T & {T} & T & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 T & F & T & {F} & F & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 F & T & F & {F} & T & \TTbf{T} & F\\
 F & F & F & {F} & F & \TTbf{T} & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Most of the columns underneath the sentence are only there for bookkeeping purposes. The column that matters most is the column underneath the \emph{main logical operator} for the sentence, since this tells you the truth value of the entire sentence. We have emphasized this, by putting this column in bold. When you work through truth tables yourself, you should similarly emphasize it (perhaps by underlining or circling).

\section{Building complete truth tables}\label{s:tt-example2}
A \define{complete truth table} has a line for every possible assignment of True and False to the relevant atomic sentences. Each line represents a \emph{valuation}, and a complete truth table has a line for all the different valuations. 

\newglossaryentry{complete truth table}
{
name=complete truth table,
description={A table that gives all the possible \glspl{truth value} for a \gls{sentence of TFL} or sentences in TFL, with a line for every possible \gls{valuation} of all atomic sentences}
}

The size of the complete truth table depends on the number of different atomic sentences in the table. A sentence that contains only one atomic sentence requires only two rows, as in the characteristic truth table for negation. This is true even if the same letter is repeated many times, as in the sentence
`$[(C\eiff C) \eif C] \eand \enot(C \eif C)$'.
The complete truth table requires only two lines because there are only two possibilities: `$C$' can be true or it can be false. The truth table for this sentence looks like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c| d e e e e e e e e e e e e e e f}
$C$&$[($&$C$&\eiff&$C$&$)$&\eif&$C$&$]$&\eand&\enot&$($&$C$&\eif&$C$&$)$\\
\hline
 T &    & T &  T  & T &   & T  & T & &\TTbf{F}&  F& &   T &  T  & T &   \\
 F &    & F &  T  & F &   & F  & F & &\TTbf{F}&  F& &   F &  T  & F &   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Looking at the column underneath the main logical operator, we see that the sentence is false on both rows of the table; i.e., the sentence is false regardless of whether `$C$' is true or false. It is false on every valuation.

A sentence that contains two atomic sentences requires four lines for a complete truth table, as in the characteristic truth tables for our binary connectives, and as in the complete truth table for `$(H \eand I)\eif H$'.

A sentence that contains three atomic sentences requires eight lines, as  shown in the table right below. Notice that the Ts and Fs in the columns below $N$ and $P$ (on the left side) follow the same pattern as the example in the previous section. The column under the $P$, meanwhile, has four Ts and then four Fs.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c|d e e e f}
$M$&$N$&$P$&$M$&\eand&$(N$&\eor&$P)$\\
\hline
%           M        &     N   v   P
T & T & T & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & T\\
T & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & F\\
T & F & T & T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & T\\
T & F & F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F\\
F & T & T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T\\
F & T & F & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F\\
F & F & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T\\
F & F & F & F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
From this table, we know that the sentence `$M\eand(N\eor P)$' can be true or false, depending on the truth values of `$M$', `$N$', and `$P$'.

A complete truth table for a sentence that contains four different atomic sentences requires 16 lines. Five letters, 32 lines. Six letters, 64 lines. And so on. To be perfectly general: If a complete truth table has $n$ different atomic sentences, then it must have $2^n$ lines.

To fill in the columns of a complete truth table, begin with the right-most atomic sentence (on the left side of the table) and alternate between `T' and `F'. In the next column to the left, write two `T's, write two `F's, and repeat. For the third atomic sentence, write four `T's followed by four `F's. This yields an eight line truth table like the one above. For a 16 line truth table, the next column of atomic sentences should have eight `T's followed by eight `F's. For a 32 line table, the next column would have 16 `T's followed by 16 `F's, and so on.


\section{Building truth tables in Carnap}\label{s:ttCarnap-intro}

You should practice making truth tables on paper, but you also need to make them using the software package Carnap (https://carnap.io/). Using Carnap is pretty straightforward, and it's made easier because the left side of the truth table is completed for you. (See figure \ref{fig:tt-1}.) On the right side, below each atomic sentence and connective, you have the option of selecting a `T' or an `F'. As we do anytime we are making a truth table, we begin by filling in the truth values for each atomic sentence (figure \ref{fig:tt-2}).  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]
%\makebox[\textwidth][l]{		% lets the table go outside the margins
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.50\textwidth}

\subcaption{}
\label{fig:tt-2}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{}
%}
\end{figure} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Next, in this example, we fill in the truth values for $(P \eor Q)$. Those values go below the `$\eor$', and, to determine what they are, we just look at the truth values for the $P$ and $Q$ that are inside the box in figure \ref{fig:tt-3}. (Note that we cannot put truth values below the `$\eand$' until we have done $(P \eor Q)$.)    

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[b]
%\makebox[\textwidth][l]{		% lets the table go outside the margins
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.50\textwidth}

\subcaption{}
\label{fig:tt-4}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{}
%}
\end{figure} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Once we have determined the truth values for $(P \eor Q)$, we can complete the truth table by filling in the values below the $\eand$. To do this, we must look at the values for the $P$ at the beginning of the sentence and the values for $(P \eor Q)$. Those are marked in figure \ref{fig:tt-4}.

We're done. Except sometimes we're not because it is easy to make a mistake when filling in a truth table. Select `Check' below the truth table, and Carnap will tell you ``Success!'' or ``Something's not quite right.'' If  something is not quite right, then you have to check every truth value until you find the mistake. Then select `Check' again. Once Carnap confirms that the truth table is correct, select `Submit'.

\section{More about brackets}\label{s:MoreBracketingConventions}
Consider these two sentences:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eand B) \eand C)\\
		(A \eand (B \eand C))
	\end{align*}
These are truth functionally equivalent. Consequently, it will never make any difference from the perspective of truth value---which is all that TFL cares about---which of the two sentences we assert (or deny). But even though the order of the brackets does not matter to the truth of the sentence, we should not just drop them. The expression
	\begin{align*}
		A \eand B \eand C
	\end{align*}
is ambiguous between the two sentences above.  The same observation holds for disjunctions. The following sentences are logically equivalent:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eor B) \eor C)\\
		(A \eor (B \eor C))
	\end{align*}
But we should not simply write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eor B \eor C
	\end{align*}
In fact, it is a specific fact about the characteristic truth table of $\eor$ and $\eand$ that guarantees that any two conjunctions (or disjunctions) of the same sentences are truth functionally equivalent, however you place the brackets. \emph{But be careful}. These two sentences have \emph{different} truth tables:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eif B) \eif C)\\
		(A \eif (B \eif C))
	\end{align*}
So if we were to write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eif B \eif C
	\end{align*}
it would be dangerously ambiguous. So we must not do the same with conditionals. Equally, these sentences have different truth tables:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eor B) \eand C)\\
		(A \eor (B \eand C))
	\end{align*}
So if we were to write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eor B \eand C
	\end{align*}
it would be dangerously ambiguous. \emph{Never write this.} The moral is never drop brackets, unless there is no possibility of ambiguity.

\chapter{Semantic concepts}
\label{s:SemanticConcepts}

In the previous section, we introduced the idea of a valuation and showed how to determine the truth value of any TFL sentence, on any valuation, using a truth table. In this section, we will introduce some related ideas, and show how to use truth tables to test whether or not they apply.


\section{Tautologies and contradictions}
In \S\ref{s:nec-truth}, we explained \emph{necessary truth}, \emph{necessary falsity}, and \textit{contingency}. The first two have surrogates in TFL. We will start with a surrogate for necessary truth.
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ is a \define{tautology} if and only if it is true on every valuation.
	}

\newglossaryentry{tautology}
{
name=tautology,
description={A sentence that has only Ts in the column under the main logical operator of its \gls{complete truth table}; a sentence that is true on every \gls{valuation}}
}

We can determine whether a sentence is a tautology using a truth table. If the sentence is true on every line of a complete truth table (that is, if there are only `T's under the main connective), then it is true on every valuation. And if it is true on every valuation, it is a tautology. The example in \S\ref{s:tt-example}, `$(H \eand I) \eif H$', for instance, is a tautology. 

This is only, though, a \emph{surrogate} for necessary truth. There are some necessary truths that we cannot adequately symbolize in TFL. An example is `$2 + 2 = 4$'. This \emph{must} be true, but if we try to symbolize it in TFL, the best we can offer is an atomic sentence, and no atomic sentence is a tautology. Still, if we can adequately symbolize some English sentence using a TFL sentence which is a tautology, then that English sentence expresses a necessary truth.

We have a similar surrogate for necessary falsity:
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ is a \define{contradiction} if and only if it is false on every valuation.
	}
\newglossaryentry{contradiction of TFL}
{
  name=contradiction (of TFL),
  text = contradiction,
description={A sentence that has only Fs in the column under the main logical operator of its \gls{complete truth table}; a sentence that is false on every \gls{valuation}}
}

\noindent We can determine whether a sentence is a contradiction just by using truth tables. If the sentence is false on every line of a complete truth table, then it is false on every valuation, so it is a contradiction. The example in \S\ref{s:tt-example2}, `$[(C\eiff C) \eif C] \eand \enot(C \eif C)$', is a contradiction.

In \S\ref{s:nec-truth}, we defined \define{contingent} as ``a sentence that is capable of being true and capable of being false (in different circumstances, of course).'' A truth table, then, provides us with those different circumstances. A sentence that is true on some lines (or even just on one line) and false on the others is contingent. Or, we can also say: any sentence that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is contingent. $\enot(P \eor Q)$, for instance, is contingent.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e f }
$P$&$Q$&\enot&$(P$&\eor&$Q)$\\
\hline
 T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T \\
 T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F \\
 F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T \\
 F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Equivalence}\label{equivalence--tt}
When we have two sentences, three possible logical relations can exist between the sentences. (Actually, there are more than three, but we'll focus on three.) The first is \define{equivalence}.

	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{equivalent} if and only if, for every valuation, their truth values agree, i.e.\ if there is no valuation in which they have opposite truth values. 
		
		(Equivalently, if $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology, then $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{equivalent}.)
	}
\newglossaryentry{equivalent}
{
  name=equivalence (in TFL),
  text = equivalent,
description={A property held by pairs of sentences if and only if the \gls{complete truth table} for those sentences has identical columns under the two main logical operators, i.e., if the sentences have the same truth value on every valuation}
}

We have already made use of this notion, in effect, in \S\ref{s:MoreBracketingConventions}; the point was that `$(A \eand B) \eand C$' and  `$A \eand (B \eand C)$' are logically equivalent. Again, it is easy to test for equivalence using truth tables. Consider the sentences `$\enot(P \eor Q)$' and `$\enot P \eand \enot Q$'. Are they logically equivalent? To find out, we construct a truth table containing both sentences.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e f |d e e e f}
$P$&$Q$&\enot&$(P$&\eor&$Q)$&\enot&$P$&\eand&\enot&$Q$\\
\hline
 T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T & F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F & F & T & \TTbf{F} & T & F\\
 F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & F & F & T & F & \TTbf{T} & T & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Look at the columns for the main logical operators; negation for the first sentence, conjunction for the second. On the first three rows, both are false. On the final row, both are true. Since they match on every row, the two sentences are logically equivalent.


\section{Consistency}\label{consistency--tt}
In \S\ref{s:joint-poss}, we said that sentences are jointly possible if and only if it is possible for all of them to be true at once. We have a surrogate for this notion too. 
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{jointly consistent} if and only if there is some valuation that makes them both true.
		\smallskip
		
		Equivalently, if
		
		~~(1) there is at least one valuation that makes ($\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}$) true, and
		
		~~(2) $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is \textit{not} a tautology,
		
		then $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{jointly consistent}.
	}

        \newglossaryentry{joint consistency in TFL}
{
  name=joint consistency (in TFL),
  text=jointly consistent,
description={A property held by sentences if and only if the \gls{complete truth table} for those sentences contains one line on which all the sentences are true, i.e., if some \gls{valuation} makes all the sentences true}
}
\noindent The requirement that $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ not be a tautology is included to distinguish sentences that are jointly consistent from those that are equivalent. It is acceptable, however, to let the two concepts overlap---that is, allow that some sentences are jointly consistent and equivalent---in which case that requirement should be dropped.

This was one of the examples in \S\ref{s:joint-poss}:
\begin{ebullet}	
		\item[G1.] \label{MartianGiraffes} There are at least four giraffes at the wild animal park.
		\item[G2.] There are exactly seven gorillas at the wild animal park.
	\end{ebullet}
These are jointly possible because it is possible for them both to be true at the same time. It takes nothing away from their joint possibility that they can also be false at the same time or one can be false while the other is true. Applying that same observation to \textit{jointly consistent}, all we need is one line where both sentences are true. (More than one line is fine also, although the truth values for the two sentences shouldn't match on every line. If they do, then the sentences are equivalent.) $(P \eor Q)$ and  $(P \eand \enot Q)$ have one line where they are both true, and so they are jointly consistent: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e f |d e e f}
$P$ &$Q$& $P$& ~\eor~ & $Q$& $P$& \eand& \enot& $Q$\\
\hline
 T & T &  T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 T & F &  T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & F\\
 F & T &  F & \TTbf{T} & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 F & F &  F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & \TTbf{F} & T & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Conversely, sentences are \define{jointly inconsistent} if there is no valuation that makes them all true. If we think about this definition for a moment, we see that there are three ways that two sentences can be jointly inconsistent. 
\begin{ebullet}	
\item[(1)] One each line, the truth value for one sentence is `T' and the truth value for the other sentence is `F'. For instance, the truth values for $P \eor Q$ and $\enot P \eand \enot Q$ never match. On each line, one is true and the other is false. Hence, for this relationship between two sentences, all of these criteria are satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology; $\enot(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology; and $(\meta{A} \eor \meta{B})$ is a tautology.
\medskip
\item[(2)] When the truth value for one sentence is `T', then the truth value for the other sentence is `F', but both sentences can be false at the same time. For example, $\enot(\enot P \eor Q)$ and $(\enot P \eand \enot Q)$ are never both true on the same line, but they are false on the same line. For sentences that are jointly inconsistent in this way, only this criterion is satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology.
\medskip
\item[(3)] Both sentences are false on every line. For example, the truth values for $\enot P \eand P$ and $\enot Q \eand Q$ are always the same. On each line, both sentences are false. So, for sentences that are jointly inconsistent in this way, both of these criteria are satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology and $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology. (And the latter, recall, means that these sentences are equivalent.) 
\end{ebullet}
