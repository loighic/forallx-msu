\chapter{Characteristic truth tables}
\label{s:CharacteristicTruthTables}

Any non-atomic sentence of TFL is composed of atomic sentences with sentential connectives. The truth value of the compound sentence depends only on the truth value of the atomic sentences that comprise it. In order to know the truth value of `$(D \eand E)$', for instance, you only need to know the truth value of `$D$' and the truth value of `$E$'. 

We introduced five connectives in chapter \ref{s:TFLConnectives}, and now we need to explain when sentences using each connective are true and false. For convenience, we will abbreviate `True' with `T' and `False' with `F'. (But just to be clear, the two truth values are \textit{true} and \textit{false}; the truth values are not letters!)

\newglossaryentry{truth value}
                 {
                   name = truth value,
                   description = {One of the two logical values sentences can have: True and False}
                   }

\paragraph{Conjunction.} For any sentences \meta{A} and \meta{B}, the conjunction (\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}) is true if and only if both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true. If one or both of \meta{A} and \meta{B} are false, then the sentence (\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}) is false. We can summarize this in the {characteristic truth table} for conjunction:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c |c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & F\\
F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Stepping back for a moment, in a truth table, the sentence (or sentences) whose truth and falsity we are investigating is on the right side of the vertical line. To the left of the vertical line are all of the atomic sentences that appear in the sentence or sentences on the right. On each line of the truth table (below the horizontal line) are different combinations of \textit{true} and \textit{false} for the atomic sentences. On the first line, there is a `T' below \meta{A} and a `T' below \meta{B}. So, this line represents the situation where \meta{A} is true and \meta{B} is true. What does that mean for the sentence $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$? Of course, you know. But you can look on the right side of the truth table, on line 1, and see that, in this situation, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is true. Likewise, on line 2, there is a `T' below \meta{A} and an `F' below \meta{B}. Checking the right side, then, we see that when \meta{A} is true and \meta{B} is false, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is false. That's the basic idea, although there is more explanation and some examples in the next chapter. 

Note that conjunction is \emph{symmetrical}. The truth value for $\meta{A} \eand \meta{B}$ is always the same as the truth value for $\meta{B} \eand \meta{A}$.  

\paragraph{Negation.} For any sentence \meta{A}: If \meta{A} is true, then \enot\meta{A} is false. If \meta{A} is false, then \enot\meta{A} is true. We can summarize this in the \emph{characteristic truth table} for negation:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\meta{A} & \enot\meta{A}\\
\hline
T & F\\
F & T 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Disjunction.} Recall that `$\eor$' always represents inclusive-or. So, for any sentences \meta{A} and \meta{B}, the disjunction $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is true when either \meta{A} or \meta{B} or both are true. The only instance when $(\meta{A}\eor \meta{B})$ is false is when both \meta{A} and \meta{B} are false. We can summarize this in the {characteristic truth table} for disjunction:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eor\meta{B}$ \\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & T\\
F & T & T\\
F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Like conjunction, disjunction is symmetrical. 

\paragraph{Conditional.} The conditional is interesting and, for some, philosophically contentious. You may know that one way to think about the conditional is as rule: if the antecedent happens, then the consequent has to happen. So, for instance, take the conditional `if I am at the grocery store, I am getting bread'. This sentence is obviously true when (1) I go to the grocery store and get bread. Conversely, this sentence is false when (2) I go to the grocery store, but don't buy bread. (If that happens, the rule has been broken.) Those two scenarios are represented by lines 1 and 2 in the characteristic truth table for the conditional.

For the other two scenarios, we have to concentrate a bit. The sentence is also true when (3) I'm not at the grocery store, but I'm getting bread somewhere else. In this case, the rule \textit{if I am at the grocery store, then I am getting bread} hasn't been broken; it just doesn't really apply. So, when the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, the conditional is true. That's represented by line 3 of the characteristic truth table for the conditional. Similarly, when (4) I am not at the grocery store, and I am not getting bread, the rule hasn't been broken. It just hasn't been invoked at all. So even though the antecedent didn't happen and the consequent didn't happen, the sentence is still true. (Again, it's still true that \textit{if} I am at the grocery store, \textit{then} I am getting bread, but since, let's say, I'm home taking a nap, it's false that `I am at the grocery store' and it's false that `I am buying bread'.) 

We summarize all of this with the characteristic truth table for the conditional:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eif\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & T\\
F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Hopefully, you understood the explanation just given for each of the four scenarios. The conditional is philosophically contentious, however, because every conditional is not as simple and straightforward as `if I am at the grocery store, then I am getting bread'. Take a conditional where the antecedent is always false: `if the queen of England is on the moon, then Mississippi State University is in Starkville.' This isn't much of a rule, but it is a conditional. And since the antecedent is false and the consequent is true, the sentence is true. Even stranger, consider this conditional: `if the queen of England is on the moon, then pigs can fly.' Now, the antecedent is false and the consequent is false, but, as is shown in line 4 of the truth table, the sentence is true. 

Sometimes the truth values for the antecedent, the consequent, and the whole conditional make sense (as in our first example) and sometimes they seem odd. That has generated philosophical debate, but it actually does not present a problem for us. The conditional is very precisely defined by the characteristic truth table for the conditional---as are all other sentences in TFL. We, then, simply use that definition, and don't have to make any decisions about whether a particular conditional should really be true or really be false. 

Also, unlike the conjunction and the disjunction, the conditional is \emph{asymmetrical}. You cannot swap the antecedent and consequent without changing the meaning of the sentence, because $\meta{A}\eif\meta{B}$ has a very different truth table from $\meta{B}\eif\meta{A}$.


\paragraph{Biconditional.} Since a biconditional is to be the same as the conjunction of a conditional running in each direction, the truth table for the biconditional is this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c}
\meta{A} & \meta{B} & $\meta{A}\eiff\meta{B}$\\
\hline
T & T & T\\
T & F & F\\
F & T & F\\
F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Unsurprisingly, the biconditional is symmetrical.

\chapter{Complete truth tables}
\label{s:CompleteTruthTables}

So far, we have considered assigning truth values to TFL sentences indirectly. We have said, for example, that a TFL sentence such as `$B$' is to take the same truth value as the English sentence `Big Ben is in London' (whatever that truth value may be), but we can also assign truth values \emph{directly}. We can simply stipulate that `$B$' is to be true, or stipulate that it is to be false.
	\factoidbox{
		A \define{valuation} is any assignment of truth values to particular atomic sentences of TFL.
	}

        \newglossaryentry{valuation}
{
name=valuation,
description={An assignment of \glspl{truth value} to particular atomic \glspl{sentence of TFL}}
}

\noindent \textbf{Each row of a truth table represents a possible valuation. The entire truth table represents all possible valuations.} Thus, the truth table provides us with a way of finding the truth values of complex sentences on each possible valuation---that is, for every combination of `true' and `false' for every atomic sentence. This is easiest to explain by example.

\section{A worked example}\label{s:tt-example}
Consider the sentence `$(H\eand I)\eif H$'. There are four possible ways to assign True and False to the atomic sentence `$H$' and `$I$'; that is, four possible valuations. They go on the left side of the truth table, and, for consistency, the Ts and Fs should be listed as they are here. In the first column (the one next to the vertical line), they alternate T, F, T, F. In the second column, they alternate in pairs, T, T, F, F. (If there are more atomic sentences than just $H$ and $I$, then more columns and more rows are needed, but the pattern remains the same.) 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T\\
 T & F\\
 F & T\\
 F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Once the left side of the truth table is filled in, to calculate the truth value of the entire sentence `$(H \eand I) \eif H$', we copy the truth values for the atomic sentences and write them underneath the letters in the sentence on the right-side of the truth table. For the $H$, that gives us:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & {T} & &  & & {T}\\
 T & F & {T} & &  & & {T}\\
 F & T & {F} & &  & & {F}\\
 F & F & {F} & &  & & {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
And then we add the truth values for $I$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & {T} & & {T} & & {T}\\
 T & F & {T} & & {F} & & {T}\\
 F & T & {F} & & {T} & & {F}\\
 F & F & {F} & & {F} & & {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now consider the subsentence `$(H\eand I)$'. This is a conjunction, $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$, and our next step is to determine the truth values  for just this subsentence. The characteristic truth table for conjunction gives the truth conditions for \emph{any} sentence of the form $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$, whatever $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ might be. It represents the point that a conjunction is true only when both conjuncts are true. In this case, our conjuncts are just `$H$' and `$I$'. They are both true on (and only on) the first line of the truth table. Accordingly, we can calculate the truth value of the conjunction on all four rows.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & T & \textbf{T} & T & & T\\
 T & F & T & \textbf{F} & F & & T\\
 F & T & F & \textbf{F} & T & & F\\
 F & F & F & \textbf{F} & F & & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now, that we have the truth values for $(H \eand I)$ the sentence that we are dealing with is a conditional, $\meta{A}\eif\meta{B}$, with `$(H \eand I)$' as \meta{A} and with `$H$' as \meta{B}. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
 & &  & \meta{A} &  &\eif &\meta{B} \\
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T &  & {T} &  &  & T\\
 T & F &  & {F} &  &  & T\\
 F & T &  & {F} &  &  & F\\
 F & F &  & {F} &  &  & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
To complete the truth table, we must determine the truth values for this conditional. On the first row, `$(H\eand I)$' is true and `$H$' is true. Since a conditional is true when the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, we write a `T' in the first row underneath the conditional symbol. On the second row, `$(H\eand I)$' is false and `$H$' is true. Since a conditional is true when the antecedent is false, we write a `T' in the second row underneath the conditional symbol. We continue for the last two rows and get this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
 & &  & \meta{A} &  &\eif &\meta{B} \\
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T &  & {T} &  &\textbf{T} & T\\
 T & F &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & T\\
 F & T &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & F\\
 F & F &  & {F} &  &\textbf{T} & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The conditional is the main logical operator of the sentence, so the column of `T's underneath the conditional tells us that the sentence `$(H \eand I)\eif H$' is true regardless of the truth values of `$H$' and `$I$'. They can be true or false in any combination, and the compound sentence still comes out true. Since we have considered all four possible assignments of truth and falsity to `$H$' and `$I$'---since, that is, we have considered all the different \emph{valuations}---we can say that `$(H \eand I)\eif H$' is true on every valuation.

In this example, we have not repeated all of the entries in every column in every successive table. When actually writing truth tables on paper, however, it is impractical to erase whole columns or rewrite the whole table for every step. Although it is more crowded, a complete truth table looks like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c| d e e e f}
$H$&$I$&$(H$&\eand&$I)$&\eif&$H$\\
\hline
 T & T & T & {T} & T & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 T & F & T & {F} & F & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 F & T & F & {F} & T & \TTbf{T} & F\\
 F & F & F & {F} & F & \TTbf{T} & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Most of the columns underneath the sentence are only there for bookkeeping purposes. The column that matters most is the column underneath the \emph{main logical operator} for the sentence, since this tells you the truth value of the entire sentence. We have emphasized this, by putting this column in bold. When you work through truth tables yourself, you should similarly emphasize it (perhaps by underlining or circling).

\section{Building complete truth tables}\label{s:tt-example2}
A \define{complete truth table} has a line for every possible assignment of True and False to the relevant atomic sentences. Each line represents a \emph{valuation}, and a complete truth table has a line for all the different valuations. 

\newglossaryentry{complete truth table}
{
name=complete truth table,
description={A table that gives all the possible \glspl{truth value} for a \gls{sentence of TFL} or sentences in TFL, with a line for every possible \gls{valuation} of all atomic sentences}
}

The size of the complete truth table depends on the number of different atomic sentences in the table. A sentence that contains only one atomic sentence requires only two rows, as in the characteristic truth table for negation. This is true even if the same letter is repeated many times, as in the sentence
`$[(C\eiff C) \eif C] \eand \enot(C \eif C)$'.
The complete truth table requires only two lines because there are only two possibilities: `$C$' can be true or it can be false. The truth table for this sentence looks like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c| d e e e e e e e e e e e e e e f}
$C$&$[($&$C$&\eiff&$C$&$)$&\eif&$C$&$]$&\eand&\enot&$($&$C$&\eif&$C$&$)$\\
\hline
 T &    & T &  T  & T &   & T  & T & &\TTbf{F}&  F& &   T &  T  & T &   \\
 F &    & F &  T  & F &   & F  & F & &\TTbf{F}&  F& &   F &  T  & F &   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Looking at the column underneath the main logical operator, we see that the sentence is false on both rows of the table; i.e., the sentence is false regardless of whether `$C$' is true or false. It is false on every valuation.

A sentence that contains two atomic sentences requires four lines for a complete truth table, as in the characteristic truth tables for our binary connectives, and as in the complete truth table for `$(H \eand I)\eif H$'.

A sentence that contains three atomic sentences requires eight lines, as  shown in the table right below. Notice that the Ts and Fs in the columns below $N$ and $P$ (on the left side) follow the same pattern as the example in the previous section. The column under the $P$, meanwhile, has four Ts and then four Fs.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c|d e e e f}
$M$&$N$&$P$&$M$&\eand&$(N$&\eor&$P)$\\
\hline
%           M        &     N   v   P
T & T & T & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & T\\
T & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & F\\
T & F & T & T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & T\\
T & F & F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F\\
F & T & T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T\\
F & T & F & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F\\
F & F & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T\\
F & F & F & F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
From this table, we know that the sentence `$M\eand(N\eor P)$' can be true or false, depending on the truth values of `$M$', `$N$', and `$P$'.

A complete truth table for a sentence that contains four different atomic sentences requires 16 lines. Five letters, 32 lines. Six letters, 64 lines. And so on. To be perfectly general: If a complete truth table has $n$ different atomic sentences, then it must have $2^n$ lines.

To fill in the columns of a complete truth table, begin with the right-most atomic sentence (on the left side of the table) and alternate between `T' and `F'. In the next column to the left, write two `T's, write two `F's, and repeat. For the third atomic sentence, write four `T's followed by four `F's. This yields an eight line truth table like the one above. For a 16 line truth table, the next column of atomic sentences should have eight `T's followed by eight `F's. For a 32 line table, the next column would have 16 `T's followed by 16 `F's, and so on.

\section{Building truth tables in Carnap}\label{s:ttCarnap-intro}

You should practice making truth tables on paper, but you also need to make them using the software package Carnap (https://carnap.io/). Using Carnap is pretty straightforward, and it's made easier because the left side of the truth table is completed for you. (See figure \ref{fig:tt-1}.) On the right side, below each atomic sentence and connective, you have the option of selecting a `T' or an `F'. As we do anytime we are making a truth table, we begin by filling in the truth values for each atomic sentence (figure \ref{fig:tt-2}).  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[h]
%\makebox[\textwidth][l]{		% lets the table go outside the margins
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.50\textwidth}

\subcaption{}
\label{fig:tt-2}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{}
%}
\end{figure} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Next, in this example, we fill in the truth values for $(P \eor Q)$. Those values go below the $\eor$, and, to determine what they are, we just look at the truth values for the $P$ and $Q$ that are inside the box in figure \ref{fig:tt-3}. (Note that we cannot put truth values below the $\eand$ until we have done $(P \eor Q)$.)    

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[b]
%\makebox[\textwidth][l]{		% lets the table go outside the margins
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.50\textwidth}

\subcaption{}
\label{fig:tt-4}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{}
%}
\end{figure} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Once we have determined the truth values for $(P \eor Q)$, we can complete the truth table by filling in the values below the $\eand$. To do this, we must look at the values for the $P$ at the beginning of the sentence and the values for $(P \eor Q)$. Those are marked in figure \ref{fig:tt-4}.

We're done. Except sometimes we're not because it is easy to make a mistake when filling in a truth table. Select `Check' below the truth table, and Carnap will tell you ``Success!'' or ``Something's not quite right.'' If  something is not quite right, then you have to check every truth value until you find the mistake. Then check it again. Once Carnap confirms that the truth table is correct, select `Submit'.

\section{More about brackets}\label{s:MoreBracketingConventions}
Consider these two sentences:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eand B) \eand C)\\
		(A \eand (B \eand C))
	\end{align*}
These are truth functionally equivalent. Consequently, it will never make any difference from the perspective of truth value---which is all that TFL cares about---which of the two sentences we assert (or deny). But even though the order of the brackets does not matter to the truth of the sentence, we should not just drop them. The expression
	\begin{align*}
		A \eand B \eand C
	\end{align*}
is ambiguous between the two sentences above.  The same observation holds for disjunctions. The following sentences are logically equivalent:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eor B) \eor C)\\
		(A \eor (B \eor C))
	\end{align*}
But we should not simply write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eor B \eor C
	\end{align*}
In fact, it is a specific fact about the characteristic truth table of $\eor$ and $\eand$ that guarantees that any two conjunctions (or disjunctions) of the same sentences are truth functionally equivalent, however you place the brackets. \emph{But be careful}. These two sentences have \emph{different} truth tables:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eif B) \eif C)\\
		(A \eif (B \eif C))
	\end{align*}
So if we were to write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eif B \eif C
	\end{align*}
it would be dangerously ambiguous. So we must not do the same with conditionals. Equally, these sentences have different truth tables:
	\begin{align*}
		((A \eor B) \eand C)\\
		(A \eor (B \eand C))
	\end{align*}
So if we were to write:
	\begin{align*}
		A \eor B \eand C
	\end{align*}
it would be dangerously ambiguous. \emph{Never write this.} The moral is never drop brackets, unless there is no possibility of ambiguity.

\chapter{Semantic concepts}
\label{s:SemanticConcepts}

In the previous section, we introduced the idea of a valuation and showed how to determine the truth value of any TFL sentence, on any valuation, using a truth table. In this section, we will introduce some related ideas, and show how to use truth tables to test whether or not they apply.


\section{Tautologies and contradictions}
In \S\ref{s:nec-truth}, we explained \emph{necessary truth}, \emph{necessary falsity}, and \textit{contingency}. The first two have surrogates in TFL. We will start with a surrogate for necessary truth.
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ is a \define{tautology} if and only if it is true on every valuation.
	}

\newglossaryentry{tautology}
{
name=tautology,
description={A sentence that has only Ts in the column under the main logical operator of its \gls{complete truth table}; a sentence that is true on every \gls{valuation}}
}

We can determine whether a sentence is a tautology using a truth table. If the sentence is true on every line of a complete truth table (that is, if there are only `T's under the main connective), then it is true on every valuation. And if it is true on every valuation, it is a tautology. The example in \S\ref{s:tt-example}, `$(H \eand I) \eif H$', for instance, is a tautology. 

This is only, though, a \emph{surrogate} for necessary truth. There are some necessary truths that we cannot adequately symbolize in TFL. An example is `$2 + 2 = 4$'. This \emph{must} be true, but if we try to symbolize it in TFL, the best we can offer is an atomic sentence, and no atomic sentence is a tautology. Still, if we can adequately symbolize some English sentence using a TFL sentence which is a tautology, then that English sentence expresses a necessary truth.

We have a similar surrogate for necessary falsity:
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ is a \define{contradiction} if and only if it is false on every valuation.
	}
\newglossaryentry{contradiction of TFL}
{
  name=contradiction (of TFL),
  text = contradiction,
description={A sentence that has only Fs in the column under the main logical operator of its \gls{complete truth table}; a sentence that is false on every \gls{valuation}}
}

\noindent We can determine whether a sentence is a contradiction just by using truth tables. If the sentence is false on every line of a complete truth table, then it is false on every valuation, so it is a contradiction. The example in \S\ref{s:tt-example2}, `$[(C\eiff C) \eif C] \eand \enot(C \eif C)$', is a contradiction.

In \S\ref{s:nec-truth}, we defined \define{contingent} as ``a sentence that is capable of being true and capable of being false (in different circumstances, of course).'' A truth table, then, provides us with those different circumstances. A sentence that is true on some lines (or even just on one line) and false on the others is contingent. Or, we can also say: any sentence that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is contingent. $\enot(P \eor Q)$, for instance, is contingent.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e f }
$P$&$Q$&\enot&$(P$&\eor&$Q)$\\
\hline
 T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T \\
 T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F \\
 F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T \\
 F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Equivalence}\label{equivalence--tt}
When we have two sentences, three possible logical relations can exist between the sentences. (Actually, there are more than three, but we'll focus on three.) The first is \define{equivalence}.

	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{equivalent} if and only if, for every valuation, their truth values agree, i.e.\ if there is no valuation in which they have opposite truth values. 
		
		(Equivalently, if $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology, then $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{equivalent}.)
	}
\newglossaryentry{equivalent}
{
  name=equivalence (in TFL),
  text = equivalent,
description={A property held by pairs of sentences if and only if the \gls{complete truth table} for those sentences has identical columns under the two main logical operators, i.e., if the sentences have the same truth value on every valuation}
}

We have already made use of this notion, in effect, in \S\ref{s:MoreBracketingConventions}; the point was that `$(A \eand B) \eand C$' and  `$A \eand (B \eand C)$' are logically equivalent. Again, it is easy to test for equivalence using truth tables. Consider the sentences `$\enot(P \eor Q)$' and `$\enot P \eand \enot Q$'. Are they logically equivalent? To find out, we construct a truth table containing both sentences.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e f |d e e e f}
$P$&$Q$&\enot&$(P$&\eor&$Q)$&\enot&$P$&\eand&\enot&$Q$\\
\hline
 T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & T & T & F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 T & F & \TTbf{F} & T & T & F & F & T & \TTbf{F} & T & F\\
 F & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T & T & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & F & F & T & F & \TTbf{T} & T & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Look at the columns for the main logical operators; negation for the first sentence, conjunction for the second. On the first three rows, both are false. On the final row, both are true. Since they match on every row, the two sentences are logically equivalent.


\section{Consistency}
In \S\ref{s:joint-poss}, we said that sentences are jointly possible if and only if it is possible for all of them to be true at once. We have a surrogate for this notion too. 
	\factoidbox{
		$\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{jointly consistent} if and only if there is some valuation that makes them both true.
		
		(Equivalently, if there is at least one valuation that makes ($\meta{A}$ \eand $\meta{B}$) true, then $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are \define{jointly consistent}.)
	}

        \newglossaryentry{joint consistency in TFL}
{
  name=joint consistency (in TFL),
  text=jointly consistent,
description={A property held by sentences if and only if the \gls{complete truth table} for those sentences contains one line on which all the sentences are true, i.e., if some \gls{valuation} makes all the sentences true}
}

This was one of the examples in \S\ref{s:joint-poss}:
\begin{ebullet}	
		\item[G1.] \label{MartianGiraffes} There are at least four giraffes at the wild animal park.
		\item[G2.] There are exactly seven gorillas at the wild animal park.
	\end{ebullet}
These are jointly possible because it is possible for them both to be true at the same time. It takes nothing away from their joint possibility that they can also be false at the same time or one can be false while the other is true. Applying that same observation to \textit{jointly consistent}, all we need is one or more lines where both sentences are true. $(P \eor Q)$ and  $(P \eand \enot Q)$ have one line where they are both true, and so they are jointly consistent: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e f |d e e f}
$P$ &$Q$& $P$& ~\eor~ & $Q$& $P$& \eand& \enot& $Q$\\
\hline
 T & T &  T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 T & F &  T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & F\\
 F & T &  F & \TTbf{T} & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & T\\
 F & F &  F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & \TTbf{F} & T & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Conversely, sentences are \define{jointly inconsistent} if there is no valuation that makes them all true. If we think about this definition for a moment, we see that there are three ways that two sentences can be jointly inconsistent. 
\begin{ebullet}	
\item[(1)] One each line, the truth value for one sentence is `T' and the truth value for the other sentence is `F'. For instance, the truth values for $P \eor Q$ and $\enot P \eand \enot Q$ never match. On each line, one is true and the other is false. Hence, for this relationship between two sentences, all of these criteria are satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology; $\enot(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology; and $(\meta{A} \eor \meta{B})$ is a tautology.
\medskip
\item[(2)] When the truth value for one sentence is `T', then the truth value for the other sentence is `F', but both sentences can be false at the same time. For example, $\enot(\enot P \eor Q)$ and $(\enot P \eand \enot Q)$ are never both true on the same line, but they are false on the same line. For sentences that are jointly inconsistent in this way, only this criterion is satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology.
\medskip
\item[(3)] Both sentences are false on every line. For example, the truth values for $\enot P \eand P$ and $\enot Q \eand Q$ are always the same. On each line, both sentences are false. So, for sentences that are jointly inconsistent in this way, both of these criteria are satisfied: $\enot(\meta{A} \eand \meta{B})$ is a tautology and $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ is a tautology. (And the latter, recall, means that these sentences are equivalent.) 
\end{ebullet}

\chapter{Entailment \& validity}\label{s:tt-validity}

\section{Entailment}\label{s:tt-entailment}

The following idea is closely related to that of joint consistency:
	\factoidbox{
		The sentences $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ \define{entail} the sentence $\meta{C}$ if there is no valuation of the atomic sentences that makes all of $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ true and $\meta{C}$ false.
	}
       \newglossaryentry{logically valid in TFL}
{
  name=logical validity (in TFL),
  text = logically valid,
description={A property held by arguments if and only if the \gls{complete truth table} for the argument contains no rows where the \glspl{premise} are all true and the \gls{conclusion} false, i.e., if no \gls{valuation} makes all premises true and the conclusion false}
}
 
Again, it is easy to test this with a truth table. Let us check whether `$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$' and `$\enot L$' entail `$J$', we simply need to check whether there is any valuation which makes both `$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$' and `$\enot L$' true whilst making `$J$' false. So we use a truth table: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f|d f| c}
$J$&$L$&\enot&$L$&\eif&$(J$&\eor&$L)$&\enot&$L$&$J$\\
\hline
%J   L   -   L      ->     (J   v   L)
 T & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & \TTbf{T}\\
 T & F & T & F & \TTbf{T} & T & T & F & \TTbf{T} & F & \TTbf{T}\\
 F & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & \TTbf{F}\\
 F & F & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & \TTbf{F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The only row on which both`$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$' and `$\enot L$' are true is the second row, and that is a row on which `$J$' is also true. So `$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$' and `$\enot L$' entail `$J$'. 

We now make an important observation:
	\factoidbox{
		If $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ entail $\meta{C}$, then $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n \therefore \meta{C}$ is valid.
	}
And, just to remind ourselves,
\factoidbox{
		An argument is \define{valid} if and only if it is impossible for all of the premises to be true and the conclusion false.
	}

Here's why entailment equals validity. If $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ entail $\meta{C}$, then there is no valuation which makes all of $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ true whilst making $\meta{C}$ false. This means that it is \emph{logically impossible} for $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ all to be true whilst $\meta{C}$ is false. But this is just what it takes for an argument, with premises $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$ and conclusion $\meta{C}$, to be valid!

In short, we have a way to test for the validity of English arguments. First, we symbolize them in TFL, as having premises $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n$, and conclusion $\meta{C}$. Then we test for entailment using truth tables. 

\section{Validity}\label{s:tt-validity}

When using a truth table to determine if an argument is valid, the premise or premises are listed first on the right side of the truth table. (In the example in \S\ref{s:tt-entailment}, `$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$' and `$\enot L$' are the premises.) The conclusion is then put last. ($J$ is the conclusion of that argument.) Once the truth table is completed, we check for \emph{bad} lines.
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where all of the premises are true and the conclusion is true \textbf{is a good line}.
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where all of the premises are true and the conclusion is false \textbf{is a bad line}.
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where the conclusion is true is \textbf{not} a bad line. 
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where at least one premise is false is \textbf{not} a bad line. 
	\end{earg}

Let's look at the truth table for an argument with one small (but significant) change: $\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$, $\enot L \therefore \enot J$. The premises are the same, but now the conclusion is $\enot J$ instead of $J$. Here is the truth table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f|d f| c}
$J$&$L$&\enot&$L$&\eif&$(J$&\eor&$L)$&\enot&$L$&$\enot J$\\
\hline
%J   L   -   L      ->     (J   v   L)
 T & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & T & T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & \TTbf{F}\\
 T & F & T & F & \TTbf{T} & T & T & F & \TTbf{T} & F & \TTbf{F}\\
 F & T & F & T & \TTbf{T} & F & T & T & \TTbf{F} & T & \TTbf{T}\\
 F & F & T & F & \TTbf{F} & F & F & F & \TTbf{T} & F & \TTbf{T}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The truth values for the premises are the same, and the truth values for the conclusion have, on each line, flipped from T to F or vice versa. Now, when we evaluate each line, what do we fine? As before, on lines 1, 3, and 4, one of the premises is false, and so they are not bad lines. On line 2, the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Bad line! That means that $\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$ and $\enot L$ do not entail $\enot J$ and the argument `$\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$, $\enot L \therefore \enot J$' is not valid.  


\section{The double-turnstile}
We are going to use the notion of entailment rather a lot in this course. It will help us, then, to introduce a symbol that abbreviates it. Rather than saying that the TFL sentences $\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots$ and $\meta{A}_n$ together entail $\meta{C}$, we will abbreviate this by:
	$$\meta{A}_1, \meta{A}_2, \ldots, \meta{A}_n \entails \meta{C}$$
The symbol `$\entails$' is known as \emph{the double-turnstile}, since it looks like a turnstile with two horizontal beams.

Let me be clear. `$\entails$' is not a symbol of TFL. Rather, it is a symbol of our metalanguage, augmented English (recall the difference between object language and metalanguage from \S\ref{s:Metalanguage}). So the metalanguage sentence:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item $P, P \eif Q \entails Q$
	\end{ebullet}
is just an abbreviation for the English sentence: 
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item The TFL sentences `$P$' and `$P \eif Q$' entail `$Q$'
	\end{ebullet}
Note that there is no limit on the number of TFL sentences that can be mentioned before the symbol `$\entails$'. Indeed, we can even consider the limiting case:
	$$\entails \meta{C}$$
This says that there is no set of sentences and no valuation for those sentences that makes $\meta{C}$ false---for example, $\entails \enot(R \eand \enot R)$ is one such sentence. Otherwise put, every valuation makes $\meta{C}$ true, which means that $\meta{C}$ is a tautology. Equally:
	$$\meta{A} \entails$$
says that $\meta{A}$ is a contradiction---for example, $(R \eand \enot R) \entails$.



\section{Checking for validity in Carnap}\label{s:tt--validity--Carnap}

When checking whether an argument is valid in Carnap, the truth table will look like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:tt-7a}. The premise, $(P \eand R)$, is separated from the conclusion, $R$, by a turnstile (`$\proves$'). (This symbol represents a different concept than the double turnstile (`$\entails$'), and chapter \ref{s:ProofTheoreticConcepts} explains how they are different. Nonetheless, for both, the premises precede the $\proves$ or $\entails$ and the conclusion follows it. And Carnap uses only the turnstile.) When an argument contains more than one premise, the premises will be separated by a comma---for example, like this: $(P \eiff (Q \eor R)), P \proves (\enot Q \eif R)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{SCfigure}[][h]
%\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{tt-7a.png} % 2.5 inches
\caption{}
\label{fig:tt-7a}
\end{SCfigure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The truth values for each atomic sentence and the connectives are filled in normally. But that will leave one column under the `$\proves$' as shown in figure \ref{fig:tt-7b}. That column will also be filled in with `T's and `F's, but there `T' and `F' don't really mean `true' and `false'. `T' means that the line is a good line. `F' means that the line is a bad line. (See \S\ref{s:tt-validity} for the definition of valid and when lines are good and when they are bad.) If all of the lines are good, then the argument is valid. If one or more of the lines is bad, the argument is invalid. 

In this example, all of the lines are good, and so we have all `T's below the `$\proves$' (figure \ref{fig:tt-9}). To reiterate, each line is a good line and the argument is valid even though, on the third line, the premise is false and the conclusion is true, and on the second and fourth lines, the premise is false and the conclusion is false. The only scenario that makes a line a bad line is when the premise (or premises) are true and the conclusion is  false.

Consider the argument in figure \ref{fig:tt-10}: $P \eor R \proves R \eif \enot P$. Here we do have a line where the premise is true and the conclusion is false. That's a bad line, and so in the column under the `$\proves$', we put an `F' there. Even though all of the other lines are fine, because we have one bad line, the argument is not valid. 

Once the truth table is completed and has been checked, submit it.

\section{`$\entails$' versus `$\eif$'}
We now want to compare and contrast `$\entails$' and `$\eif$'. 

Observe: $\meta{A} \entails \meta{C}$ if and only if there is no valuation of the atomic sentences that makes $\meta{A}$ true and $\meta{C}$ false. 

Observe: $\meta{A} \eif \meta{C}$ is a tautology if and only if there is no valuation of the atomic sentences that makes $\meta{A} \eif \meta{C}$ false. Since a conditional is true except when its antecedent is true and its consequent false, $\meta{A} \eif \meta{C}$ is a tautology iff there is no valuation that makes $\meta{A}$ true and $\meta{C}$ false. 

Combining these two observations, we see that $\meta{A} \eif \meta{C}$  is a tautology iff  $\meta{A} \entails \meta{C}$. But there is a really, really important difference between `$\entails$' and `$\eif$':
	\factoidbox{`$\eif$' is a sentential connective of TFL.\\ `$\entails$' is a symbol of augmented English.
	}
Indeed, when `$\eif$' is flanked with two TFL sentences, the result is a longer TFL sentence. By contrast, when we use `$\entails$', we form a metalinguistic sentence that \emph{mentions} the surrounding TFL sentences. 


\section{The limits of these tests}\label{s:ParadoxesOfMaterialConditional}
We have reached an important milestone: a test for the validity of arguments! However, we should not get carried away just yet. It is important to understand the \emph{limits} of our achievement. We will illustrate these limits with three examples.

First, consider the argument: 
	\begin{earg}
		\item Daisy has four legs. Therefore, Daisy has more than two legs.
	\end{earg}
To symbolize this argument in TFL, we would have to use two different atomic sentences---perhaps `$F$'  and `$T$'---for the premise and the conclusion respectively. Now, it is obvious that `$F$' does not entail `$T$'. The English argument surely seems valid, though!

Second, consider the sentence:
	\begin{earg}
\setcounter{eargnum}{1}
		\item\label{n:JohnBald} John is neither bald nor not-bald.
	\end{earg}
To symbolize this sentence in TFL, we would offer something like `$\enot J \eand \enot \enot J$'. This a contradiction (check this with a truth-table), but sentence \ref{n:JohnBald} does not seem like a contradiction; for we might have happily gone on to add ``John is on the borderline of baldness''!

Third, consider the following sentence:
	\begin{earg}
\setcounter{eargnum}{2}	
		\item\label{n:GodParadox}	It's not the case that, if God exists, he answers malevolent prayers.
%	Aaliyah wants to kill Zebedee. She knows that, if she puts chemical A into Zebedee's water bottle, Zebedee will drink the contaminated water and die. Equally, Bathsehba wants to kill Zebedee. She knows that, if she puts chemical B into Zebedee's water bottle, then Zebedee will drink the contaminated water and die. But chemicals A and B neutralize each other; so that if both are added to the water bottle, then Zebedee will not die.
	\end{earg}
        Symbolizing this in TFL, we would offer something like `$\enot (G \eif M)$'. Now, `$\enot (G \eif M)$' entails `$G$' (again, check this with a truth table). So if we symbolize sentence \ref{n:GodParadox} in TFL, it seems to entail that God exists. But that's strange: surely even an atheist can accept sentence \ref{n:GodParadox}, without contradicting herself!

        One lesson of this is that the symbolization of \ref{n:GodParadox} as `$\enot(G \eif M)$' shows that \ref{n:GodParadox} does not express what we intend. Perhaps we should rephrase it as
        	\begin{earg}
                  \setcounter{eargnum}{2}	
                \item\label{n:GodParadox2} If God exists, he does not answer malevolent prayers.
  \end{earg}
and symbolize \ref{n:GodParadox2} as `$G \eif \enot M$'.  Now, if atheists are right, and there is no God, then `$G$' is false and so `$G \eif \enot M$' is true, and the puzzle disappears. However, if `$G$' is false, then `$G \eif M$' (i.e., `If God exists, he answers malevolent prayers') is \emph{also} true!
                
In different ways, these four examples highlight some of the limits of working with a language like TFL that can \emph{only} handle truth-functional connectives. Moreover, these limits give rise to some interesting questions in philosophical logic. The case of John's baldness (or otherwise) raises the general question of what logic we should use when dealing with \emph{vague} discourse. The case of the atheist raises the question of how to deal with the (so-called) \emph{paradoxes of the material conditional}. Part of the purpose of this course is to equip you with the tools to explore these questions of \emph{philosophical logic}. But we have to walk before we can run; and  so we have to become proficient using TFL, before we can adequately discuss its limits and consider alternatives.

%\meta{A} and \meta{B} have the same truth value on every line of a complete truth table, so $\meta{A}\eiff\meta{B}$ is true on every line. It is a tautology.
\item Suppose that $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})\eif\meta{C}$ is neither a tautology nor a contradiction. What can you say about whether $\meta{A}, \meta{B} \therefore\meta{C}$ is valid?
%The sentence is false on some line of a complete truth table. On that line, \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true and \meta{C} is false. So the argument is invalid.
\item Suppose that $\meta{A}$, $\meta{B}$ and $\meta{C}$  are jointly inconsistent. What can you say about $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B}\eand\meta{C})$?
\item Suppose that \meta{A} is a contradiction. What can you say about whether $\meta{A}, \meta{B} \entails \meta{C}$?
%Since \meta{A} is false on every line of a complete truth table, there is no line on which \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true and \meta{C} is false. So the argument is valid.
\item Suppose that \meta{C} is a tautology. What can you say about whether $\meta{A}, \meta{B}\entails \meta{C}$?
%Since \meta{C} is true on every line of a complete truth table, there is no line on which \meta{A} and \meta{B} are true and \meta{C} is false. So the argument is valid.
\item Suppose that \meta{A} and \meta{B} are logically equivalent. What can you say about $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$?
%Not much. $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$ is a tautology if \meta{A} and \meta{B} are tautologies; it is a contradiction if they are contradictions; it is contingent if they are contingent.
\item Suppose that \meta{A} and \meta{B} are \emph{not} logically equivalent. What can you say about $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$?
%\meta{A} and \meta{B} have different truth values on at least one line of a complete truth table, and $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$ will be true on that line. On other lines, it might be true or false. So $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$ is either a tautology or it is contingent; it is \emph{not} a contradiction.

		\item Suppose $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are logically equivalent. Suppose an argument contains $\meta{A}$ (either as a premise, or as the conclusion). The validity of the argument would be unaffected, if we replaced $\meta{A}$ with $\meta{B}$.
	\end{ebullet}
Is this principle correct? Explain your answer.



\chapter{Truth table shortcuts}
With practice, you will quickly become adept at filling out truth tables. In this section, we want to give you some permissible shortcuts to help you along the way. 

\section{Working through truth tables}
You will quickly find that you do not need to copy the truth value of each atomic sentence, but can simply refer back to them. So you can speed things up by writing:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f}
$P$&$Q$&$(P$&\eor&$Q)$&\eiff&\enot&$P$\\
\hline
 T & T &  & T &  & \TTbf{F} & F\\
 T & F &  & T &  & \TTbf{F} & F\\
 F & T &  & T & & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 F & F &  & F &  & \TTbf{F} & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
You also know for sure that a disjunction is true whenever one of the disjuncts is true. So if you find a true disjunct, there is no need to work out the truth values of the other disjuncts. Thus you might offer:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e e e f}
$P$&$Q$& $(\enot$ & $P$&\eor&\enot&$Q)$&\eor&\enot&$P$\\
\hline
 T & T & F & & F & F& & \TTbf{F} & F\\
 T & F &  F & & T& T& &  \TTbf{T} & F\\
 F & T & & &  & & & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 F & F & & & & & &\TTbf{T} & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Equally, you know for sure that a conjunction is false whenever one of the conjuncts is false. So if you find a false conjunct, there is no need to work out the truth value of the other conjunct. Thus you might offer:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e e e f}
$P$&$Q$&\enot &$(P$&\eand&\enot&$Q)$&\eand&\enot&$P$\\
\hline
 T & T &  &  & &  & & \TTbf{F} & F\\
 T & F &   &  &&  & & \TTbf{F} & F\\
 F & T & T &  & F &  & & \TTbf{T} & T\\
 F & F & T &  & F & & & \TTbf{T} & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A similar short cut is available for conditionals. You immediately know that a conditional is true if either its consequent is true, or its antecedent is false. Thus you might present:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e e f}
$P$&$Q$& $((P$&\eif&$Q$)&\eif&$P)$&\eif&$P$\\
\hline
 T & T & &  & & & & \TTbf{T} & \\
 T & F &  &  & && & \TTbf{T} & \\
 F & T & & T & & F & & \TTbf{T} & \\
 F & F & & T & & F & &\TTbf{T} & 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
So `$((P \eif Q) \eif P) \eif P$' is a tautology. In fact, it is an instance of \emph{Peirce's Law}, named after Charles Sanders Peirce.


\section{Testing for validity and entailment}

As we said in \S\ref{s:tt-validity}, when we use truth tables to test for validity or entailment, we are checking for \emph{bad} lines: lines where the premises are all true and the conclusion is false. Consequently,
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where the conclusion is true is not a bad line. 
		\item[\textbullet] Any line where some premise is false is not a bad line. 
	\end{earg}
Since \emph{all} we are doing is looking for bad lines, if we find a line where the conclusion is true, we do not need to evaluate anything else on that line. That line definitely isn't bad. Likewise, if we find a line where some premise is false, we do not need to evaluate anything else on that line. 

With this in mind, consider how we might test the following for validity:
	$$\enot L \eif (J \eor L), \enot L \therefore J$$
The \emph{first} thing we should do is evaluate the conclusion. If we find that the conclusion is \emph{true} on some line, then that is not a bad line, and so we can simply ignore the rest of the line. At our first stage, we are left with something like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f |d f|c}
$J$&$L$&\enot&$L$&\eif&$(J$&\eor&$L)$&\enot&$L$&$J$\\
\hline
%J   L   -   L      ->     (J   v   L)
 T & T & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 T & F & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 F & T & &&?&&&&?&& {F}\\
 F & F & &&?&&&&?&& {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The blank spaces under $\enot L \eif (J \eor L)$ and $\enot L$  indicate that we are not going to bother doing any more investigation (since the line is not bad). The question-marks indicate that we need to keep investigating. On those lines, it is possible that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. 

The easiest premise to evaluate is the second ($\enot L$), so we do that next:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f |d f|c}
$J$&$L$&\enot&$L$&\eif&$(J$&\eor&$L)$&\enot&$L$&$J$\\
\hline
%J   L   -   L      ->     (J   v   L)
 T & T & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 T & F & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 F & T & &&&&&&{F}&& {F}\\
 F & F & &&?&&&&{T}&& {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now we see that we no longer need to consider the third line: it will not be a bad line, because (at least) one of the premises is false on that line, $\enot L$. Finally, we complete the fourth line:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c|d e e e e f |d f|c}
$J$&$L$&\enot&$L$&\eif&$(J$&\eor&$L)$&\enot&$L$&$J$\\
\hline
%J   L   -   L      ->     (J   v   L)
 T & T & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 T & F & &&&&&&&& {T}\\
 F & T & &&&&&&{F}& & {F}\\
 F & F & T &  & \TTbf{F} &  & F & & {T} & & {F}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Since the fourth line tells us that---for those valuations of $J$ and $L$---the first premise is false, the truth table has no bad lines. Hence, the argument is valid: any valuation for which all the premises are true is a valuation for which the conclusion is true.

It might be worth illustrating the tactic again. Let us check whether the following argument is valid
$$A\eor B, \enot (A\eand C), \enot (B \eand \enot D) \therefore (\enot C\eor D)$$
At the first stage, we determine the truth value of the conclusion. Since this is a disjunction, it is true whenever either disjunct is true, so we can speed things along a bit. We can then ignore every line apart from the few lines where the conclusion is false. (Notice that the negation in the conclusion is determined for just those lines were $D$ is false.)
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c | c|c|c|d e e f }
$A$ & $B$ & $C$ & $D$ & $A\eor B$ & $\enot (A\eand C)$ & $\enot (B\eand \enot D)$ & $(\enot$ &$C$& $\eor$ & $D)$\\
\hline
T & T & T & T & & & & &  &  \TTbf{T} & \\
T & T & T & F & ? & ? & ? & F & &  \circled{\TTbf{F}} & \\
T & T & F & T &  & &   & & &  \TTbf{T} & \\
T & T & F & F &  &  &   & T & &  \TTbf{T} &\\
T & F & T & T &  &  &  & & &  \TTbf{T} & \\
T & F & T & F & ? & ? & ?  & F &  &  \circled{\TTbf{F}} &\\
T & F & F & T & & & & & & \TTbf{T} &\\
T & F & F & F & & & & T &  & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & T & T & T & & & & & & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & T & T & F & ? & ? & ? & F &  & \circled{\TTbf{F}} &\\
F & T & F & T & & &  & & & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & T & F & F & & & &T & & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & F & T & T & & & & & & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & F & T & F & ? & ? & ? & F & & \circled{\TTbf{F}} & \\
F & F & F & T & & & & & & \TTbf{T} & \\
F & F & F & F & & & & T& & \TTbf{T} & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We must now evaluate the premises. The first premise is the simplest, so we start there. Of the four lines where the conclusion is false, there are three where $A \eor B$ is true. So the truth values for the next premise have to be determined for those three lines. (The second premise is simpler to evaluate than the third, so it's next.) Knowing the truth value for $\enot(A \eand C)$ leaves us with one line where the first two premise are true. A little bit more work tells us that the third premise is false on that line. There is no line where the premises are true and the conclusion is false! The argument is valid.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[t]{c c c c | d e f |d e e f |d e e e f |d e e f }
$A$ & $B$ & $C$ & $D$ & $A$ & $\eor$ & $B$ & $\enot$ & $(A$ &$\eand$ &$ C)$ & $\enot$ & $(B$ & $\eand$ & $\enot$ & $D)$ & $(\enot$ &$C$& $\eor$ & $D)$\\
\hline
T & T & T & T & & && & && & && & & & &  &  \TTbf{T} & \\

F & F & F & F & & && & && & && & & & T& & \TTbf{T} & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
If we had used no shortcuts, we would have had to write 256 `T's or `F's on this table. Using shortcuts, we only had to write 37. We have saved ourselves a \emph{lot} of work.

We have been discussing shortcuts in testing for logically validity, but exactly the same shortcuts can be used in testing for entailment. By employing a similar notion of \emph{bad} lines, you can save yourself a huge amount of work.

\chapter{Partial truth tables}\label{s:PartialTruthTable}

Sometimes, we do not need to know what happens on every line of a truth table. Sometimes, just a line or two will do. 

\paragraph{Tautology.} 
In order to show that a sentence is a tautology, we need to show that it is true on every valuation. That is to say, we need to know that it comes out true on every line of the truth table. So we need a complete truth table. 

To show that a sentence is \emph{not} a tautology, however, we only need one line: a line on which the sentence is false. Therefore, in order to show that some sentence is not a tautology, it is enough to provide a single valuation---a single line of the truth table---which makes the sentence false. 

Suppose that we want to show that the sentence `$(U \eand T) \eif (S \eand W)$' is \emph{not} a tautology. We set up a \define{partial truth table}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c |d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
   &   &   &   &    &   &    &\TTbf{F}&    &   &   
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We have only left space for one line, rather than 16, since we are only looking for one line on which the sentence is false. For just that reason, we have filled in `F' for the entire sentence. 

The main logical operator of the sentence is a conditional. In order for the conditional to be false, the antecedent must be true and the consequent must be false. So we fill these in on the table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c |d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
   &   &   &   &    &  T  &    &\TTbf{F}&    &   F &   
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In order for the `$(U\eand T)$' to be true, both `$U$' and `$T$' must be true.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c|d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
   & T & T &   &  T &  T  & T  &\TTbf{F}&    &   F &   
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Now we just need to make `$(S\eand W)$' false. To do this, we need to make at least one of `$S$' and `$W$' false. We can make both `$S$' and `$W$' false if we want. All that matters is that the whole sentence turns out false on this line. Making an arbitrary decision, we finish the table in this way:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c|d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
 F & T & T & F &  T &  T  & T  &\TTbf{F}&  F &   F & F  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We now have a partial truth table, which shows that `$(U \eand T) \eif (S \eand W)$' is not a tautology. Put otherwise, we have shown that there is a valuation which makes `$(U \eand T) \eif (S \eand W)$' false, namely, the valuation which makes `$S$' false, `$T$' true, `$U$' true and `$W$' false. 

\paragraph{Contradiction.}
Showing that something is a contradiction requires a complete truth table: we need to show that there is no valuation which makes the sentence true; that is, we need to show that the sentence is false on every line of the truth table. 

However, to show that something is \emph{not} a contradiction, all we need to do is find a valuation which makes the sentence true, and a single line of a truth table will suffice. We can illustrate this with the same example.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c|d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
  &  &  &  &   &   &   &\TTbf{T}&  &  &
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
To make the sentence true, it will suffice to ensure that the antecedent is false. Since the antecedent is a conjunction, we can just make one of them false. For no particular reason, we choose to make `$U$' false; and then we can assign whatever truth value we like to the other atomic sentences.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c|d e e e e e f}
$S$&$T$&$U$&$W$&$(U$&\eand&$T)$&\eif    &$(S$&\eand&$W)$\\
\hline
 F & T & F & F &  F &  F  & T  &\TTbf{T}&  F &   F & F
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Truth functional equivalence.}
To show that two sentences are logically equivalent, we must show that the sentences have the same truth value on every valuation. So this requires a  complete truth table.

To show that two sentences are \emph{not} logically equivalent, we only need to show that there is a valuation on which they have different truth values. So this requires only a one-line partial truth table: make the table so that one sentence is true and the other false.

\paragraph{Consistency.}
To show that some sentences are jointly consistent, we must show that there is a valuation which makes all of the sentences true,so this requires only a partial truth table with a single line. 

To show that some sentences are jointly inconsistent, we must show that there is no valuation which makes all of the sentence true. So this requires a complete truth table: You must show that on every row of the table at least one of the sentences is false.

\paragraph{Validity.}
To show that an argument is valid, we must show that there is no valuation which makes all of the premises true and the conclusion false. So this  requires a complete truth table.  (Likewise for entailment.)

To show that argument is \emph{invalid}, we must show that there is a valuation which makes all of the premises true and the conclusion false. So this requires only a one-line partial truth table on which all of the premises are true and the conclusion is false. (Likewise for a failure of entailment.)

This table summarises what is required:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
%\cline{2-3}
 & \textbf{Yes} & \textbf{No}\\
 \hline
%\cline{2-3}
tautology? & complete & one-line partial \\
