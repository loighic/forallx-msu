\chapter{Form and symbolization}\label{symbolization}

\section{Validity in virtue of form}\label{s:ValidityInVirtueOfForm}
Let's examine two arguments. This is the first one:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] If Claire is in the safe house, then the agency still has the document.
		\item[2.] Claire is in the safe house.
		\item[3.] Therefore, the agency still has the document.
	\end{earg}
This is the second:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] If Mary escaped to Tangier, then Simon is a double agent.
		\item[2.] Mary escaped to Tangier.
		\item[3.] Therefore, Simon is a double agent.
	\end{earg}
Both arguments are valid, and, as perhaps you  can see, they share a common form. We can represent the form by itself this way:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] If A, then B
		\item[2.] A
		\item[3.] Therefore, B
	\end{earg}
Any argument with this form will be valid. It doesn't matter what English sentences are put in the places of A and B. 

Here is another valid argument:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] Seoul is larger than London.
		\item[2.] London is larger than Chicago.
		\item[3.] Therefore, Seoul is larger than Chicago. 
	\end{earg}
This argument also has a particular form that makes it valid, and we can represent its form like this:
\bigskip

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.99\textwidth}
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] C is larger than D.
		\item[2.] D is larger than F.
		\item[3.] Therefore, C is larger than F. 
	\end{earg}
	\end{minipage}

\noindent For the first argument form that we examined, A and B could be any sentences. Here, C, D, and F are names (not full sentences), and we can put any names (for anything) in the places of C, D, and F, and the argument will remain valid.

In contrast, this argument is valid, but there is no particular form that makes it so.
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] Kate is an oncologist.
		\item[2.] Therefore, Kate is a doctor.
	\end{earg}
Unlike the previous three examples, this argument is not valid because of the form of the argument. Rather, it's valid because of the particular meanings of \textit{oncologist} and \textit{doctor}. 

These examples illustrate the idea of \define{validity in virtue of form}. The arguments about Claire, Mary, Simon, Seoul, London, and Chicago are valid, but---unlike the argument about Kate---their being valid has nothing to do with the specific meaning of `Claire is in the safe house', `Simon is a double agent', `Seoul', `London', or `Chicago.' (Whether the arguments are sound depends on these meanings, but not whether the arguments are valid.) Instead, these arguments are valid in virtue of the meanings of just these words: \textit{if, then} and \textit{is larger than}.

\begin{factboxy}{valid in virtue of form}
Let us define \define{structure words} as \textit{if-then}, \textit{and}, \textit{or}, \textit{not}, \textit{if and only if}, and comparative adjectives followed by \textit{than} (e.g., \textit{larger than}, \textit{faster than}, \textit{older than}).

An argument is \define{valid in virtue its form} when the argument contains properly organized structure words. When it does, any sentences or names can be substituted into the argument and it will remain valid. 
\end{factboxy}

\noindent This is not a perfect definition. \textit{Form} in formal logic is much broader than just the use of these ``structure words.'' This is a good definition with which to start, however.

And, although valid for reasons other than the argument's form is an interesting topic, our focus will be on arguments that are valid because of their form---and in fact, only valid in virtue of some forms. In part 5, we will broaden the analysis a bit, but in parts  \ref{ch.TFL} --  \ref{ch.NDTFL} of this textbook, we will be interested in arguments where the form is set by the use of  \textit{if-then}, \textit{and}, \textit{or}, \textit{not}, and \textit{if and only if}. 

%\ref{ch.TruthTables}, and

\begin{notebox}
Going forward, we will set aside arguments that are valid because they employ comparative adjectives. To make a final point about them, though, arguments that use comparative adjectives are valid because these terms denote a \define{transative relation}. Such a relation exists when the relation between two elements in a series applies to any elements in the series as long as the elements are taken in order. 
\end{notebox}

Here are some examples of arguments that are valid in virtue of \textit{or}, \textit{not}, and \textit{and}.
This one:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] Claire is either a student, or she is a spy.
		\item[2.] Claire is not a student.
		\item[3.] Therefore, Claire is a spy.
	\end{earg}
has this form:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] G or H
		\item[2.] not G
		\item[3.] Therefore, H
	\end{earg}
And this argument:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] It's not the case that Jeff both studies often and acts in lots of plays.
		\item[2.] Jeff acts in lots of plays.
		\item[3.] Therefore, Jeff does not study often.
	\end{earg}
has a form that we can represent like this:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[1.] not (K and L)
		\item[2.] L
		\item[3.] Therefore, not K
	\end{earg}

\filbreak

\section{Atomic sentences and symbolization}\label{s:atomic}

Consider this sentence again:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[(a)] If Claire is in the safe house, then the agency has the document.
	\end{earg}
`Claire is in the safe house' and `The agency has the document' are \textit{subsentences} of sentence (a). To specify the structure of the first argument in this chapter, we replaced the sentences and subsentences in it with individual letters. `Claire is in the safe house' was replaced with `A', and `The agency has the document' was replaced with `B'. This kind of representation---letters standing for sentences or subsentences---is one important part of the formal language developed in this textbook.

\begin{factboxy}{Atomic sentences}
Again, we define \define{sentence} as a statement that can be true or false. When no smaller sentence can be extracted from a sentence, it is an \define{atomic sentence}.\medskip

In English, an atomic sentence is a declarative sentence that does not contain any subsentences.\smallskip

In our logic system, an atomic sentence is a single capital letter in this font: $A, B, C, D, E . . .$.
\end{factboxy}

Atomic sentences are the basic building blocks used to form more complex sentences. We will use uppercase Roman letters for atomic sentences in our logic system. If, by chance, we ever need more than twenty-six different atomic sentences, we can obtain additional ones by adding subscripts to letters. Here, for instance, are five different atomic sentences:
	$$M, P, P_{\text{\tiny 1}}, P_{\text{\tiny 2}}, M_{\text{\tiny 17}}$$

We will use atomic sentences to represent, or \emph{symbolize}, certain English sentences. To do this, we provide a \define{symbolization key}, such as the following.
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[A] Claire is in the safe house.
		\item[B] The agency has the document.
	\end{ekey}
When we do this, we are not fixing this symbolization once and for all. We are just, for the time being, letting `$A$' symbolize the English sentence `Claire is in the safe house', and `$B$' symbolize the English sentence `The agency has the document'. Later, when we are dealing with different sentences or different arguments, we can provide a new symbolization key; for instance, 
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[A] Jake stole the code.
		\item[B] Jake is on the train.
	\end{ekey}

\chapter{Logical operators}
\label{s:TFLConnectives}

\define{Truth-functional logic} is a branch of logic that focuses on the relationships between atomic sentences. One part of truth-functional logic (or `TFL' for short) is a formal language. This formal language consists of atomic sentences of TFL (see \S \ref{s:atomic}) and the \define{logical} or \define{truth-functional operators} `and', `or', `not', `if \ldots, then \ldots' and `if and only if'. 

A logical operator is a word or phrase that modifies a sentence or connects two sentences to form a more complex sentence. We call these operators \textit{truth-functional} because the truth of the complex sentences depends entirely on the truth of the atomic sentences of which they are composed. (These operators are also sometimes referred to as \textit{connectives} since, except for `not', they all connect two simpler sentences.)  

In addition to symbolizing English sentences with sentence letters, we also want to symbolize the logical operators. The symbols that we will use are shown in table \ref{table.connectives}. The operators listed there are not the only ones that we have in English. Others are, for example, `unless', `neither \dots{} nor \dots', `necessarily', and `because'. As we will see, the first two can be expressed with the connectives that are in table \ref{table.connectives}. The last two, however, cannot. Although they are logical operators, `necessarily' and `because' are not truth functional.

\begin{table*}\centering\sffamily\footnotesize
\ra{1.25}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l l l@{}}\toprule
\textth{symbol} & \textth{the sentence's name} & \textth{its meaning}\\\midrule
	\enot&negation&`It is not the case that $\ldots$.'\\
	\eand&conjunction&`Both $\ldots$, and $\ldots$.'\\
	\eor&disjunction&`Either $\ldots$, or $\ldots$.'\\
	\eif&conditional&`If $\ldots$, then $\ldots$.'\\
	\eiff&biconditional&`$\ldots$ if and only if $\ldots$.'\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The logical operators of truth functional logic. See table \ref{symbols-Carnap} on p.~\pageref{symbols-Carnap} for instructions about how to type these symbols.}\label{table.connectives}
\end{table*}
	
Once we have introduced these logical operators (in this chapter and in chapter \ref{s:CharacteristicTruthTables}) and have explained what can and cannot be a sentence in TFL (which we will do in chapter \ref{s:TFLSentences}), our formal language will be complete. Although the formal language is central, truth-functional logic does not consist only of a formal language. There is also a \textit{deductive system}, which we will explore in part \ref{ch.NDTFL}. 

        
\section{Negation}

Consider how we might symbolize these sentences:
	\begin{earg}
	\item[\ex{not1}] Mary is in Barcelona.
	\item[\ex{not2}] It is not the case that Mary is in Barcelona.
	\item[\ex{not3}] Mary is not in Barcelona.
	\end{earg}
To begin, we need an atomic sentence. This will be our symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[M] Mary is in Barcelona.
	\end{ekey}
	
$M$ is sentence \ref{not1}, and so we don't need to do anything else there. 
The second sentence is partially symbolized as `It is not the case that $M$'. In order to complete the symbolization, we need a symbol for `it is not the case that'. Or, put differently, we need a symbol that, when added to $M$, will express `the negation of $M$'. We will use `\enot' and symbolize sentence \ref{not2} as $\enot M$.

Sentence \ref{not3} is worded a little bit differently, but it is equivalent to sentence \ref{not2}. As such, we can also symbolize it as $\enot M$.

\begin{factboxy}{Negation}
A sentence can be symbolized as $\enot\meta{A}$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `It is not the case that \ldots '.
\end{factboxy}

Here are a few more examples:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{not4}] The cog can be replaced.
		\item[\ex{not5}] The cog is irreplaceable.
		\item[\ex{not5b}] The cog is not irreplaceable.
	\end{earg}
For these, we will use this symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[R] The cog is replaceable
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{not4} is symbolized just by $R$. Sentence \ref{not5} can be reworded as \textit{it is not the case that the cog is replaceable}. So even though sentence \ref{not5} does not contain the word `not', we will symbolize it $\enot R$.
Sentence \ref{not5b}, you will notice, is the denial of sentence \ref{not5}. So, we symbolize \ref{not5b} as $\enot\enot R$.

Finally, consider these English sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{not6}] Jane is happy.
		\item[\ex{not7}] Jane is unhappy.
	\end{earg}
If we use $H$ stand for `Jane is happy', then we can symbolize sentence \ref{not6} as $H$. It would be a mistake, however, to symbolize sentence \ref{not7} with $\enot{H}$. 
$\enot{H}$ means `Jane is not happy', but `Jane is not happy' does not have the same meaning as `Jane is unhappy'. After all, Jane might be neither happy nor unhappy; her mood might just be neutral. In order to symbolize sentence \ref{not7}, we would need a different sentence letter.


\section{Conjunction}
\label{s:ConnectiveConjunction}

Let's start with these sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{and1}] Sam is on the train, and Kate is on the train.
		\item[\ex{and2}] Sam is not on the train, but Kate is on train.
		\item[\ex{and3}] It is not the case that both Sam and Kate are on the train.
	\end{earg}
Even though they are both about being on the train, we need these two sentence letters to translate sentences \ref{and1}, \ref{and2}, and \ref{and3}:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[S] Sam is on the train.
		\item[K] Kate is on the train.
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{and1} can be partially symbolized as ($S$ and $K$). For the `and', we will use `\eand', which is called the \textit{ampersand}. Thus, sentence \ref{and1} becomes $(S\eand K)$. 

When two sentences are connected with an `$\eand$', the resulting sentence is called a \define{conjunction}. The two sentences that are combined with the `$\eand$' are the \define{conjuncts}. So, $S$ and $K$ are the conjuncts of $(S \eand K)$.

For sentence \ref{and2}, we symbolize `Sam is not on the train' as $\enot S$. `But' may have a slightly different meaning in English than `and', but, grammatically, `but' and `and' do the same job: they join two sentences as a conjunction. Thus, sentence \ref{and2} is symbolized as $(\enot S \eand K)$.

Sentence \ref{and3} is a little more complicated. We know from the previous section that `it is not the case that' is symbolized with the `$\enot$'. Therefore, we can partially symbolize this sentence like this:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] $\enot$ both Sam and Kate are on the train
	\end{earg}
`Both Sam and Kate are on the train' is equivalent to sentence \ref{and1}, and so we symbolize it as $(S \eand K)$. Putting this together, we get $\enot(S \eand K)$. 

Notice the difference between sentences \ref{and2} and \ref{and3} in English and how we translated them into truth-functional logic. In sentence \ref{and2}, the negation only applies to `Sam is on the train'. Thus, the `$\enot$' is right next to the $S$. In sentence \ref{and3}, the negation applies to the whole `both Sam and Kate are on the train'. Consequently, we need to have the `$\enot$' outside the parentheses to indicate that the whole $(S \eand K)$ is being negated.

\begin{notebox}
There is a method for distributing the `$\enot$' inside the parentheses, but it's not as simple as just moving the `$\enot$' next to both sentence letters. In other words,  $\enot(S \eand K) \neq (\enot S \eand \enot K)$.  
\end{notebox}

Finally, we don't symbolize the `both' in \ref{and3}, other than to use the `$\eand$' between the $S$ and the $K$. The `both' indicates where the conjunction begins, which is important for distinguishing sentences \ref{and2} and \ref{and3}, and it is also sometimes used in English just for emphasis. It doesn't, however, have any separate meaning in truth-functional logic.

% Depending on how the layout falls, the conjunction definition box could go here. (It's after then next paragraph right now.)

\subsection{Parentheses}

Although we will relax this requirement later, in truth-functional logic, conjunctions, as well as the types of sentences that we will discuss in sections \ref{s:ConnectiveDisjunction} - \ref{s:biconditional-1}, should be enclosed in parentheses. (A negation [for instance, $\enot P$] should not, though.) The purpose of the parentheses is to let us be perfectly explicit about how each logical operator is related to each sentence letter in a sentence. 


\begin{factboxy}{Conjunction}
A sentence can be symbolized as $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ if it can be paraphrased any of these ways in English:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{earg}
\item[] `Both \ldots, and\ldots.'
\item[] `\ldots, and \ldots.'
\item[] `\ldots, but \ldots.' 
\item[] `\ldots, although \ldots.'
\item[] `\ldots, as well as \ldots.'
\end{earg}
\end{factboxy}
	


\section{Disjunction}
\label{s:ConnectiveDisjunction}

We will start with these sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{or1}] Tom is at the train station, or Kate driving to Santa Fe.
		\item[\ex{or2}] Kate is driving to Santa Fe, and either Tom is at the train station or Sarah is at the train station. 
	\end{earg}
And we will use this symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[K] Kate is driving to Santa Fe.
		\item[S] Sarah is at the train station.
		\item[T] Tom is at the train station.
	\end{ekey}
To represent the `or' in sentences \ref{or1} and \ref{or2}, we will use the symbol `$\eor$' (which we call the \textit{wedge}, not \textit{v}). Sentence \ref{or1}, then, is written as $(T \eor K)$. When two sentences are connected with an `$\eor$', the resulting sentence is called a \define{disjunction}. $T$ and $K$ are the \define{disjuncts} of $(T \eor K)$.

In sentence \ref{or2}, we have an \textit{and} and an \textit{or}. But this way of symbolizing the sentence is wrong:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] $(K \eand T \eor S)$ 
	\end{earg}
We have to determine, and reveal in the TFL sentence, if the $T$ goes with the $K$ like this:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] $((K \eand T) \eor S)$ 
	\end{earg}
Or with the $S$ like this:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] $(K \eand (T \eor S))$ 
	\end{earg}
In the English sentence, the `either' indicates where the disjunction begins. Hence, $(T \eor S)$ is the disjunction, and $K \eand \ldots$ precedes it, giving us this: $(K \eand (T \eor S))$.


\begin{factboxy}{Disjunction}
A sentence can be symbolized as $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `Either\ldots, or\ldots.'
\end{factboxy}

\subsection{The inclusive or}\label{inclusive-or-1}

Sometimes in English, the word `or' is used in a way that excludes the possibility that both disjuncts are true. This is called the \define{exclusive or}.  An \emph{exclusive or} is clearly intended when it says on a restaurant menu ``Entrees come with either soup or salad.'' This means that, with your entree, you may have soup or you may have salad, but you cannot have both.

At other times, the word `or' allows for the possibility that both disjuncts might be true. For instance, Amy might say, ``I am going to get an A in Logic or an A in German III.'' She probably means that she will get an A in one or both of these courses. (After all, if she ends up getting an A in both, we wouldn't insist that she was wrong when she said, ``I am going to get an A in Logic or an A in German III,'' and we wouldn't expect her to try to get a B in one if she knew that she was going to get an A in the other.)

When, by ``A or B,'' we mean that A is true or B is true or \textit{both} are true, then we are using the \define{inclusive or}. The TFL symbol `\eor' always symbolizes an \emph{inclusive or}.

\subsection{Negation and disjunction}

Think about these sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{or3}] Either Kate is not at the train station, or Sarah is not at the train station.
		\item[\ex{or4}] Neither Kate nor Sarah is at the train station.
		\item[\ex{or.xor}] Either Kate is at the train station or Sarah is at the train station, but both are not.
	\end{earg}
Sentence \ref{or3} is symbolized as $(\enot K \eor \enot S)$. Sentences \ref{or4} and \ref{or.xor} are a little trickier. 

According to sentence \ref{or4}, neither one is at the train station. Therefore, we can paraphrase it like this:
\begin{ebullet}
	\item[] It is not the case that either Amy is at the train station or Sarah is at the train station. 
\end{ebullet}
As our paraphrased sentence shows, we are negating the entire disjunction. Hence, we symbolize sentence \ref{or4} as $\enot (K \eor S)$. 

Sentence \ref{or.xor} expresses the meaning of the \textit{exclusive or}: one or the other, but not both. The `$\eor$', however, represents the \textit{inclusive or}: one or the other, or both. Therefore, to represent \ref{or.xor} in TFL, we need to break the sentence into two parts. 

The first part, `Kate is at the train station or Sarah is at the train station', is symbolized as $(K \eor S)$. The second part, which states that both won't be there, is paraphrased this way: `It is not the case that both Kate is at the train station and Sarah is at the train station'. We symbolize this as $\enot(K \eand S)$. We put the two parts together with an `and', and sentence \ref{or.xor} becomes $((K \eor S) \eand  \enot(K \eand S))$.

These last two examples demonstrate that we can sometimes symbolize English sentences that, at first, appear not to be using the logical operators of TFL. (That is, the ones listed in table \ref{table.connectives}.) We can do this as long as we can figure out a way to paraphrase the English sentence so that it is using some combination of `\textit{and}', `\textit{or}' (i.e., the inclusive-or), `\textit{not}', `\textit{if \ldots, then \ldots}', and `\textit{if and only if}'. 


\section{Conditional}

We will start with this sentence:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{if1}] If Jean is in Paris, then Jean is in France.
	\end{earg}
And we will use this symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[P] Jean is in Paris.
		\item[F] Jean is in France
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{if1} has this form: if P, then F, and we call this type of sentence a \define{conditional}. We will use `\eif' to symbolize \textit{if \ldots, then \ldots}. Thus, sentence \ref{if1} becomes $(P\eif F)$. 

In a conditional, what goes before the `$\eif$'  is called the \define{antecedent}, and what comes after the `$\eif$' is called the \define{consequent}. So, in sentence \ref{if1}, `Jean is in Paris' is the antecedent, and `Jean is in France' is the consequent.

\begin{factboxy}{Conditional}
A sentence can be symbolized as $(\meta{A} \eif \meta{B})$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `If A, then B'.
\end{factboxy}

Many English expressions can be represented using the conditional, and the most common alternatives to `if $\meta{A}$, then $\meta{B}$' are listed in table \ref{table.conditional.English}. If you think about it, you'll see that all six of the sentences in the table have the same meaning, and so they can all be symbolized as ($\meta{A} \eif \meta{B}$). (Or, in this case, as ($P \eif F$).)


\begin{table*}[b]\centering\sffamily\footnotesize
\ra{1.25}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l l@{}}\toprule
If Jean is in Paris, then she is in France & If $\meta{A}$, then $\meta{B}$.\\

Jean is in France provided that she is in Paris. 	&	$\meta{B}$ provided that $\meta{A}$.\\
Provided that Jean is in Paris, she is in France. 	&	Provided that $\meta{A}$, $\meta{B}$.\\
Jean is in Paris only if she is in France. 	&	$\meta{A}$ only if $\meta{B}$.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The most common way of expressing a conditional in English is as `If Jean is in Paris, then she is in France.' This table lists some alternative but equivalent ways of expressing the same sentence.}\label{table.conditional.English}
\end{table*}


\section{Biconditional}\label{s:biconditional-1}

All of the logical operators that we have discussed so far are ones with which you were already familiar because you are an English speaker. The biconditional, which is mostly commonly expressed as `\textit{\ldots if and only if \ldots}', is one that you might not have really noticed before---even if you have used it on occasion. We'll start with the basic case.
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{iff1}] The Bulldogs won if and only if they scored more points than the Razorbacks.
	\end{earg}
And this will be our symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[P] The Bulldogs scored more points than the Razorbacks.
		\item[W] The Bulldogs won.
	\end{ekey}
The symbol `\eiff' will stand for `if and only if', and so we can symbolize sentence \ref{iff1} as $(W \eiff P)$.

That's how we translate an English sentence containing \textit{if and only if} into TFL. But let's think about what \textit{if and only if} means. If sentence \ref{iff1} is true, then which of these conditionals must also be true?
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{iff2}] If the Bulldogs won, then they scored more points than the Razorbacks.
		\item[\ex{iff3}] If the Bulldogs scored more points than the Razorbacks, then they won.
	\end{earg}
The answer is both must be true.
	
From the previous section, you know that we symbolize sentences \ref{iff2} and \ref{iff3} like this:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ref{iff2}.] $(W \eif P)$
		\item[\ref{iff3}.] $(P \eif W)$ 
	\end{earg}
So, sentence \ref{iff1} is equivalent to $((W \eif P) \eand (P \eif W))$, which is why we call $(W \eiff P)$ a \define{biconditional}: it is equivalent to the two conditionals that have their antecendent and consequent switched.

The expression `if and only if' occurs frequently in philosophy, mathematics, and logic, and sometimes you will see it abbreviated `iff'. (Although even when `iff' is written, we still say `if and only if.') 

\begin{factboxy}{Biconditional}
A sentence can be symbolized as $(\meta{A} \eiff \meta{B})$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `A if and only if B'.
\end{factboxy}
	
%A word of caution. Ordinary speakers of English often use `if \ldots, then\ldots' when they really mean to use something more like `\ldots if and only if \ldots'. Perhaps your parents told you when you were a child: `if you don't eat your vegetables, you won't get any dessert'. Suppose that you ate your vegetables, but that your parents refused to give you any dessert, on the grounds that they were only committed to the \emph{conditional} (roughly `if you get dessert, then you will have eaten your vegetables'), rather than the biconditional (roughly, `you get dessert if and only if you eat your vegetables'). Despite the valuable lesson in truth functional propositional logic, you would have been upset. So, be aware of this when interpreting what people say, and in your own writing, make sure you use \textit{if and only if} if and only if you mean to use it.

\section{Unless}\label{s:unless}
We have now introduced all of the logical operators of TFL. We can use them together to symbolize many kinds of sentences. An especially difficult case is when we use the English-language connective `unless'. Take this sentence:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{unless1}] You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket. 
\end{earg}
To symbolize \ref{unless1}, we will use this symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[J] You will wear a jacket.
		\item[D] You will catch a cold.
	\end{ekey}

One meaning of sentence \ref{unless1} is that if you do not wear a jacket, then you will catch a cold. This we symbolize as $(\enot J \eif D)$. Alternatively, the sentence can mean that if you do not catch a cold, then you must have worn a jacket. This is symbolized as $(\enot D \eif J)$. And, finally, it can also mean that either you will wear a jacket or you will catch a cold. This, we symbolize as $(J \eor D)$.

All three ways of symbolizing sentence \ref{unless1} are correct. In fact, in chapter \ref{s:SemanticConcepts}, we will see that these three TFL sentences are equivalent. Following the somewhat standard practice, however, we will define \textit{unless} as a disjunction.
	
\begin{factboxy}{Unless}
If a sentence can be paraphrased as `A unless B,' then it can be symbolized as `$(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$'.
\end{factboxy}

There is a complication with treating `unless' as a disjunction, however. As we said earlier, `or' has an inclusive and an exclusive meaning, but in TFL, `or' is always inclusive. Speakers of English, however, often use `unless' to mean something more like the exclusive-or. Suppose someone says: `I will go running unless it snows'. They probably mean `either I will go running or it will snow, but not both'. So, it can be argued that the conditional---i.e., `if it does not snow, then I will go running' or ($\enot S \eif R$)---captures the meaning of \textit{unless} better than does the disjunction.


\section{The turnstile}

The final symbol that we need is, technically, not a symbol of TFL, but it is useful to have when stating an argument. The symbol `\proves' is called the \textit{turnstile}. The purpose of the turnstile is to separate the sentences that are the premises of an argument from the sentence that is the conclusion, and it can be read as \textit{therefore}. Here is an example,
$$(P \eif Q), (P \eor S) \proves (\enot Q \eif S)$$
In this argument, the premises are $(P \eif Q)$ and $(P \eor S)$, and the conclusion is $(\enot Q \eif S)$.


%\begin{notebox}
%Like the metavariables `$\meta{A}, \meta{B}, \meta{C}, \meta{D}, \ldots$', `\proves' is a symbol of our metalanguage, augmented English. The %difference between the object language and the metalanguage is explained in \S\ref{s:Metalanguage}.

\chapter{Sentences of TFL}\label{s:TFLSentences}

`Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell' is a sentence of English. $(P \eor Q)$ is a sentence of TFL. Oddly, although we can identify sentences of English when we encounter them, there is not a formal definition of \textit{sentence of English} that will tell us, for any possible combination of words and punctuation, whether or not it is a sentence of English. It is possible, however, to provide such a definition for sentences of TFL, and we will examine that definition in this chapter. 

\section{Expressions}

\begin{table*}\centering\sffamily\footnotesize
\ra{1.25}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l l@{}}\toprule
atomic sentences & $A,B,C,\ldots,Z$\\
\enspace {with subscripts if needed} & $A_1, A_2, A_3,A_4, \ldots, J_{10}, J_{11}, \ldots$\\

parentheses &( , )\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The three types of symbols of TFL}\label{table.symbols-TFL}
\label{TFL-symbols}
\end{table*}

You have been introduced to the symbols of TFL in the previous two chapters. They are also summarized in table \ref{TFL-symbols}. We define an \define{expression of TFL} as any string of symbols of TFL. Take any of the symbols of TFL and write them down, in any order, and you have an expression of TFL.


\section{Sentences}\label{s:Sentences}
Many expressions of TFL will be total gibberish. We want to know when an expression of TFL amounts to a \emph{sentence}. To that end, we have the following seven rules, which are one part of the grammar of TFL.


%Instead, we will describe the process by which sentences can be constructed. Consider negation. Take any sentence of TFL and call it \meta{A}. Since \meta{A} is a sentence of TFL, putting an `$\enot$' before it will yield a new sentence of TFL: $\enot\meta{A}$.

%We can stipulate similar rules for each of the other logical operators. For instance, if \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences of TFL, then combining them with an `$\eand$' and brackets will yield a new sentence of TFL: $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$. Providing rules like this for all of the logical operators, we arrive at the following formal definition for a \define{sentence of TFL}.

\begin{factboxy}{Sentences of TFL}\label{TFLsentences}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Every atomic sentence is a sentence.
		\item If \meta{A} is a sentence, then $\enot\meta{A}$ is a sentence.
		\item If \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences, then $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is a sentence.
		\item If \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences, then $(\meta{A}\eor\meta{B})$ is a sentence.
		\item If \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences, then $(\meta{A}\eif\meta{B})$ is a sentence.
		\item If \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences, then $(\meta{A}\eiff\meta{B})$ is a sentence.
		\item Nothing else is a sentence.
	\end{enumerate}
%\tcblower
\hrule
\medskip
\footnotesize{Notice that \meta{A} and $A$ are different fonts. $A$ is an atomic sentence in TFL. \meta{A} (which is not, actually, part of TFL) is a \textit{metavariable}. It stands for any sentence of TFL. The sentence that it stands for could be anything: $A$ or $(B \eif D)$ or $((P \eiff Q) \eor T)$ or anything else. This use of {metavariables} is explained more fully in \S\ref{s:Metavariables}.}
\end{factboxy}

From the previous chapter, you have the basic idea about how the logical operators are used. The simplest cases are when `$\eand$, `$\eor$', `$\eif$', or `$\eiff$' only connect two atomic sentences or when `$\enot$' is before a single atomic sentence, as we find here:  
\begin{earg}
\item[] $(P \eiff Q)$
\item[] $\enot R$
\end{earg}
But our logic system must be more complex than this to be useful. To see how we can create more complex sentences in TFL, we will start with these two sentences:
\begin{earg}
\item[] $(P \eand S)$
\item[] $(R \eif T)$
\end{earg}
Now, let’s see how we would express ``$(P \eand S)$ \textit{or} $(R \eif T)$.'' Although 
$(P \eand S)$ and
$(R \eif T)$
are both composed of two atomic sentences and a logical operator, we can treat each as a unit and combine them with a `$\eor$’ like this:
\begin{earg}
\item[]$((P \eand S) \eor (R \eif T))$
\end{earg}
\noindent Similarly, we can express `\textit{not} $(P \eand S)$' by treating the $(P \eand S)$ as a unit and adding a `$\enot$’:
\begin{earg}
\item[] $\enot(P \eand S)$
\end{earg}
We can even, if we need to do so, express `\textit{not} $\enot(P \eand S)$' by implementing the same procedure again. Now, $\enot(P \eand S)$ is the unit and we add a `$\enot$’ to it:
\begin{earg}
\item[] $\enot\enot(P \eand S)$
\end{earg}

These procedures can be used to form an infinite number of sentences of TFL. We just have to be sure that we are following rules 1 -- 7, given on p.~\pageref{TFLsentences}.  And when following these rules, we must remember that $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ are units that can stand for either single atomic sentences or longer sentences. In fact, they can stand for sentences of any length.

Ultimately, you want to be able to just look at an expression and tell whether or not it is a correctly formed sentence of TFL, and with time you will be able to do so. Here are some examples of sentences of TFL:
\begin{earg}
\item $((P \eand R) \eif (S \eif T))$
\item $(P \eand (R \eif (S \eif T)))$
\item $((P \eiff \enot S) \eor \enot(T \eiff R))$
\item $((R \eiff T) \eand \enot(P \eor (Q \eor \enot T)))$
\item $\enot(P \eif \enot(R \eor (S \eiff T)))$
\item $((S \eor P) \eand \enot(R \eor \enot\enot R))$
\end{earg}
These, on the other hand, are \textit{\textbf{not}} sentences of TFL because each violates one or more of 1 -- 7:
\begin{earg}
\item $(P\enot \eand R)$
\item $((R \eand \eor S) \eif Q)$
\item $(R \eand Q \eif)$
\item $((P \enot Q) \eand (R \eiff T))$
\item $(P,Q \eiff T)$
\item $(P \eand Q \eand R)$
\end{earg}

You will learn to recognize sentences of TFL more quickly if you write neatly and space the atomic sentences, logical operators, and parentheses as is shown in this textbook. Spaces are not actually part of TFL, and so technically, you don't need to use them. But just as you would never add or drop spaces when writing sentences in English, you should not add or drop spaces when using TFL.


\section{The main logical operator}
\label{main_logical_operator}

Setting aside the `$\enot$' for a moment, each of the other logical operators, as you know, combine two sentences (which may, themselves, be composed of multiple sentences). The two sentences that are joined together by a logical operator comprise that operator's \define{scope}. 

\begin{factboxy}{Scope}
For `$\eand$', `$\eor$', `$\eif$', and `$\eiff$', the \define{scope} of the logical operator is the two sentences that the logical operator is conjoining. 
\smallskip

For `\enot', the \define{scope} is the sentence being negated by this operator.
\end{factboxy}

So, the scope of the `$\eand$' in $(P \eand Q)$ is the $P$ and the $Q$ And the scope of the `$\eand$' in $((P \eand Q) \eif T)$ is still just the $P$ and the $Q$. The scope of the `$\eif$' in $((P \eand Q) \eif T)$ is $(P \eand Q)$ and $T$.

Here is a more complex example:

$$(((T \eif P) \eand R) \eor (S \eiff Q))$$

\begin{ebullet}
	\item[] The scope of the `$\eif$' is $T$ and $P$. 
	\item[] The scope of the `$\eand$' is $(T \eif P)$ and $R$.
	\item[] The scope of the `$\eiff$' is $S$ and $Q$.
	\item[] The scope of the `$\eor$' is $((T \eif P) \eand R)$ and $(S \eiff Q)$.
\end{ebullet}

When the scope of a logical operator is the whole sentence (besides that operator itself), then that logical operator is the \define{main logical operator}. So, in the previous example, the `$\eor$' is the main logical operator. This means that the sentence is a disjunction. (The subsentences are different kinds of sentences, but the whole sentence is a disjunction.)

\begin{factboxy}{Main Logical Operator (MLO)}
The \define{main logical operator} is the logical operator whose scope is the entire sentence. 
\end{factboxy}

Being able to identify the main logical operator is very important for what you will be learning in parts 3 and 4 of this textbook, and so when you see a sentence of TFL, you always want to determine the scope of each logical operator and the identify the main logical operator. 

Here are some more examples:
\begin{tabbing}
\quad$((P \eand R) \eif (\enot Q \eand S))$ \qquad \qquad \qquad \= The MLO is the `$\eif$'.\\\smallskip 
\quad$(((S \eor N) \eiff Q) \eand (T \eif R))$ \> The MLO is the `$\eand$'.\\\smallskip
\quad$(((\enot D \eor N) \eif R) \eiff T)$ \> The MLO is the `$\eiff$'.\\\smallskip
\quad$(P \eand (T \eiff (Q \eor R)))$ \> The MLO is the `$\eand$'.\\\smallskip
\quad$((\enot E \eor F) \eiff G)$ \> The MLO is the `$\eiff$'.
\end{tabbing}


Unlike the other operators, the `$\enot$', doesn't connect two sentences; it just negates a sentence (which may be composed of multiple subsentences). Hence, the scope of the `$\enot$' is the sentence that is being negated. For each of these examples, the scope of the `$\enot$' is the whole sentence (besides the `$\enot$' itself): 

\begin{earg}
\item[] $\enot Q$
\item[] $\enot(P \eor T)$
\item[] $\enot(R \eor (S \eif N))$
\item[] $\enot((P \eand R) \eor (S \eif T))$
\end{earg}
And since, in each of these examples, the scope of the `$\enot$' is the whole sentence, the `$\enot$' is the main logical operator in each case.


Once the main logical operator has been identified, we know what kind of sentence we have and what its components are. (This will be super important when we get to chapter \ref{s:BasicTFL}.)
If it is a conjunction, then part of the sentence will be one conjunct and the rest will be the other conjunct (and nothing will be left over). If it's a disjunction, then part of the sentence will be one disjunct and the rest will the other disjunct, again with nothing left over. If it's a conditional, then part of the sentence will be the antecedent and the rest will be the consequent. And if it's a negation, then the whole sentence (minus the `not' itself) is being negated.


%\subsection{another way of indentifying the main logical operator}

%Alternatively, when the sentence includes the outermost brackets, you can find the main logical operator by using this method:
%\begin{ebullet}
%	\item[(1)] If the first symbol in the sentence is `$\enot$', then that is the main logical operator.
%	\item[(2)] Otherwise, start counting the brackets by following one of these two procedures. (The open-bracket is `(' and the closed bracket is `)'.) 
%	\begin{earg}
%	\item[(2a)] Start from the left, and begin counting. For each open-bracket add $1$, and for each closing-bracket, subtract $1$. When your count is at exactly $1$, the next operator you come to (\emph{apart} from a `$\enot$') is the main logical operator. 
%	\item[(2b)] If starting at the left-side of the sentence doesn't seem to work, follow the same procedure, but begin at the far right and work left. % Is working in this direction the only way that an `$\enot$' would be the next logical operator, but not the main one?
%	\end{earg}
%\end{ebullet}

%As we will discuss in the next section, in some cases, it is acceptable to omit the outermost brackets in a sentence of TFL. For instance, although it is not strictly allowable according to the rules given in \S\ref{s:Sentences}, because it will not introduce any confusion or ambiguity, we can write `$(P \eand R) \eif Q$' instead of `$((P \eand R) \eif Q)$'. When the outermost brackets are dropped, we add (3) and (4) to our method.

%\begin{ebullet}
%\item[(3)] When the outermost brackes are omitted, (2a) and (2b) can still be used, but stop when your count gets to zero instead of $1$.
%\item[(4)] For sentences that contain two or more atomic sentences, if `$\enot$' is the main logical operator, then the outermost brackets have to be used. (When `$\enot$' is the main logical operator---as it is in this example: $\enot((P \eand Q) \eor R)$---the `$\enot$' will be outside the outermost brackets.) 
%\item[(5)] For sentences that contain two or more atomic sentences, when the outermost brackets are omitted, (1) no longer applies and `$\enot$' won't be the main logical operator. 
%\end{ebullet}


\section{Using parentheses}
\label{TFLconventions}

Parentheses are required for any sentence of TFL containing two or more atomic sentences. One reason for this is because the rules given on p.~\pageref{TFLsentences} require it. Another reason for using parentheses is that we might make a sentence, say, $(Q \eand R)$, a sub-sentence in a more complex sentence. For example, we might want to negate $(Q \eand R)$, which would give us $\enot(Q \eand R)$. If we just had $Q \eand R$ without the parentheses and put a `$\enot$' in front of it, we would have $\enot Q \eand R$, which has a different meaning than $\enot(Q\eand R)$. 

That said, there are some convenient conventions that we can use as long as we are careful. First, if the entire sentence is not about to become a sub-sentence,  we can omit the sentence's \emph{outermost} parentheses. Thus, we allow ourselves to write $Q \eand R$ instead of $(Q \eand R)$ when $Q \eand R$ is the whole sentence. We must remember, however, to put parentheses around it when we want to embed the sentence into a more complex one.

Second, it can be a bit difficult to stare at long sentences with many nested pairs of parentheses. To make things a bit easier on the eyes, we will allow ourselves to use square brackets, `[' and `]', in addition to rounded ones. So, there is no logical difference, for example, between $(P\eor Q)$ and $[P\eor Q]$. 

Combining these two conventions, we can rewrite this sentence:
$$(((H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)) \eand (J \eor K))$$
like this:
$$[(H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)] \eand (J \eor K)$$
The scope of each logical operator is now much easier to identify.

\noindent\begin{minipage}{1.0\textwidth}
\section{Object language and metalanguage}\label{s:Metalanguage}

Consider these two sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{JT1}] Justin Trudeau is a Prime Minister.
		\item[\ex{JT2}] \textit{Justin Trudeau} is the Canadian Prime Minister's name.
	\end{earg}
When we want to talk about the Prime Minister of Canada, which we are doing in sentence \ref{JT1}, we \textit{use} his name. When we want to talk about the Prime Minister's name, as we are in sentence \ref{JT2} we \emph{mention} the name.
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-3pt}

Since we are describing a formal language, truth-functional logic, we often \emph{mention} sentences of TFL. For example, we are mentioning $P \eif Q$ in sentence \ref{TFL1}:
\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{TFL1}] $P \eif Q$ is a conditional.
\end{earg}

\noindent And likewise, we are mentioning TFL sentences in \ref{obj1} and \ref{obj2}. 
\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{obj1}] $D$ is an atomic sentence of TFL.
		\item[\ex{obj2}] $\enot (\enot Q \eor R)$ is a sentence of TFL if $(\enot Q \eor R)$ is a sentence of TFL.
\end{earg}

When we talk about a language (i.e., mention it), the language about which we are talking is called the \define{object language}. The language that we use to talk about the object language is called the \define{metalanguage}.\label{def.metalanguage} 

The object language that concerns us right now is TFL, but any language can be an object language. If, for instance, we want to talk about German, then German is the object language, and English---the language we are using to talk about German---is the metalanguage. Here is an example:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{Ger2}]`Schnee ist wei\ss' is a German sentence.
	\end{earg}
In sentence \ref{Ger2}, we are saying that the clause at the beginning of the sentence is a German sentence. 

Whenever we want to talk, in English, about some specific expression of TFL, we need to indicate that we are \textit{mentioning} the expression, rather than \textit{using} it. We can do this by using single quotation marks or italics (although italics are also sometimes used simply for emphasis and not to indicate that we are mentioning a term or sentence). In this textbook, we will also indicate that we are mentioning an expression by placing it centered on the page like this:
\vspace{-2mm}
$$\enot(\enot Q \eor R)$$

\end{comment}


\section{Metavariables}\label{s:Metavariables}

Sometimes we refer to specific sentences of TFL like $P$ and $\enot (\enot Q \eor R)$. Other times, however, we want to say something about an arbitrary sentence of TFL, not a specific one. To do this, we use these uppercase letters:
\vspace{-2mm}
	$$\meta{A}, \meta{B}, \meta{C}, \meta{D}, \ldots$$
	
You probably noticed that we used these letters in our definition of a sentence of TFL in section \ref{s:Sentences}. For instance, this is one rule in that definition:
\begin{earg}
\item[3.] If \meta{A} and \meta{B} are sentences of TFL, then $(\meta{A}\eand\meta{B})$ is a sentence of TFL.
\end{earg}
We use $\meta{A}$ and $\meta{B}$ (and other capital letters in this font) when we want the letter to stand for any possible sentence of TFL. Hence, $\meta{A}$ can stand for $A$ (or $B$) or for $(P \eor Q)$ or $((R \eif T) \eand \enot Q)$ or anything else that counts as a sentence of TFL. 

$\meta{A}, \meta{B}, \meta{C}, \meta{D},$ etc. are not actually part of TFL. Rather, they are a part of  English, and we use them to talk about expressions of TFL. 
	
\begin{factboxy}{Metavariable}
A \define{metavariable} is a variable in the metalanguage (i.e., English) that represents any sentence in TFL. The symbols $\meta{A}, \meta{B}, \meta{C}, \meta{D}, \ldots$ are used for the metavariables.
\end{factboxy}

\begin{notebox}
When we use one language to talk about another one, the language about which we are talking is called the \define{object language}, and the language that we use to talk about the object language is called the \define{metalanguage}

\label{pr.wiffTFL}
For each of the following, (a) is it, strictly speaking, a sentence of TFL, and (b) is it a sentence of TFL when we allow ourselves to drop the outermost parentheses and use square brackets? If, by either of these standards, it is a sentence of TFL, then (c) what is the main logical operator?
\begin{earg}
\item $(A)$
\item $J_{374} \eor \enot J_{374}$
\item $\enot \enot \enot \enot F$
\item $\enot \eand S$
\item $(G \eand \enot G)$
\item $(A \eif (A \eand \enot F)) \eor (D \eiff E)$
\item $[(Z \eiff S) \eif W] \eand [J \eor X]$
\item $(F \eiff \enot D \eif J) \eor (C \eand D)$
\end{earg}

%Are there any sentences of TFL that contain no atomic sentences? Explain your answer.
%\\\myanswer{No. Atomic sentences contain atomic sentences (trivially). And every more complicated sentence is built up out of less complicated sentences, that were in turn built out of less complicated sentences, \ldots, that were ultimately built out of atomic sentences.}\\


\problempart $[(H \eif I) \eor (G \eiff M)] \eand (J \eor K)$
\medskip

\noindent The scope of the `$\eif$' is $H$ and $I$. 

\noindent The scope of the `$\eiff$' is $G$ and $M$. 

\noindent The scope of the first `$\eor$' is $(H \eif I)$ and $(G \eiff M)$.

\noindent The scope of the second `$\eor$' is $J$ and $K$.

\noindent\hangindent=3mm The scope of the `$\eand$' is $[(H \eif I) \eor (G \eiff M)]$ and $(J \eor K)$. Therefore, the `$\eand$' is the main logical operator, and the sentence is a conjunction.
