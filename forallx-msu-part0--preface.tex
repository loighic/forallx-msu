\chapter{Preface}

I will begin by quoting E. J. Lemmon.
\begin{quote}
It is not easy, and perhaps not even useful, to explain briefly what logic is. Like most subjects, it comprises many different kinds of problem and has no exact boundaries; at one end, it shades off into mathematics, at another, into philosophy. The best way to find out what logic is is to do some. (1965, p. 1)
\end{quote}
He then continues, ``None the less, a few very general remarks about the subject may help to set the stage for the rest of this book.'' Following his lead, here are some general remarks. First, formal logic is the study of formal languages. Unlike natural languages (such as English, Spanish, and Mandarin), in a formal language, every part of the language is precisely defined. Using a formal language limits what we can do. Natural languages are extremely flexible and adaptable; by and large, formal languages are not. The trade-off, however, is that formal languages are very precise, and the ones that we will investigate make clear some of the fundamental aspects of human reasoning.

Second, this textbook is designed for a single semester introduction to formal (i.e., deductive) logic. It primarily covers \textit{truth-functional logic}. (For reference, truth-functional logic also goes by other names: \textit{propositional logic} and \textit{sentential logic}.) In truth functional logic, individual statements (e.g., ``the missing painting is in storage'' or ``Westerby is talking with Ricardo'') are treated as units that can be combined into more complex statements with  \textit{or}, \textit{and}, \textit{not}, \textit{if \ldots then \ldots}, and \textit{if and only if}. The study of truth functional logic, then, is the study of the properties of these more complex statements and the logical relationships between them. 

The final part of the book introduces \textit{first-order logic}, which includes, in addition to the ‘or’, ‘and’, ‘not’, ‘if \ldots then \ldots’, and `if and only if', \textit{names}, \textit{variables}, \textit{predicates}, \textit{identity}, and what are called \textit{quantifiers}. These additional elements of the language make it much more expressive than the truth-functional language, and this broadens the logical analysis that can be undertaken. 

Incidentally, the title \textit{forall\hspace{.10em}x} (i.e., ``for all x'') is a reference to \textit{first-order logic}. This is a symbolic expression in first-order logic: $\forall x(Kx \eif Gx)$, and it is read, “for all \textit{x}, if \textit{x} is \textit{K}, then \textit{x} is \textit{G}.” Hence, the name of the textbook. (If, for instance, \textit{K} stands for ``is a king,'' and \textit{G} stands for ``is greedy,'' then $\forall x(Kx \eif Gx)$ means ``for all \textit{x}, if \textit{x} is a king, then \textit{x} is greedy,'' or ``everyone who is a king is greedy.'') 


\section{For instructors}

This textbook is for a single semester course in formal logic. It is assumed that the students will have no prior exposure to formal logic (or to informal logic for that matter). The textbook covers truth functional (i.e., propositional) logic and introduces first-order logic. The coverage of the former is designed to guide students as they develop the ability to evaluate arguments using truth tables and proofs. The coverage of the later is only intended to expose students, in the last two or three weeks of the semester, to the syntax of FOL, translation to and from FOL, and simple proofs using the rules of derivation for FOL. 

The rules of derivation for TFL are listed in section \ref{ProofRules} in the appendix, and proofs are constructed using Fitch notation.

This book is based on a text originally written by P. D. Magnus and revised and expanded by Tim Button, J. Robert Loftis, Aaron Thomas-Bolduc, and Richard Zach. I have made additional revisions, taken out chapters that are not needed for the 1000-level logic course at Mississippi State University, and added instructions for using the logic software Carnap (\href{http://carnap.io/}{http://carnap.io/}), which can be used in conjunction with Parts \ref{ch.TruthTables} - \ref{ch.FOL}.
